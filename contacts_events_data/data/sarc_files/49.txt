   Cargill Confidential   - 1 -   * Confidential treatment  {E8 requested}  

  A. Cargill has  {E9 developed}  a yeast strain  {E10 designated}  CB1 ("CB1") for  {E11 fermenting}  dextrose and/or  {E12 mixed}  sugar streams and related research  tools for  {E13 modifying}  CB1,which are  {E14 protected}  by Licensed Patents (as  {E15 defined}  in Section 2.5 below). B. Bioamber  {E16 desires}  to  {E17 engage}  Cargill to further  {E18 develop}  or  {E19 modify}  CB1 with the goal of  {E20 fermenting}  dextrose and/or  {E21 mixed}  sugar streams to   {E22 produce}  succinic acid and salts thereof. C. The Parties  {E23 desire}  to  {E24 grant}  each other certain rights to  {E25 use}  the further  {E26 developed}  or  {E27 modified}  CB1 as well as other technology that is   {E28 developed}  in the course of the work as  {E29 provided}  in this Development Agreement for research purposes only. 1. Scope of Work Plan  1.1 Cargill  {E30 agrees}  to  {E31 perform}  the services to  {E32 develop}  or  {E33 modify}  CB1 to  {E34 produce}  succinic acid and salts thereof  {E35 using}  dextrose ( {E36 defined}  as  glucose) and/or sucrose as the fermentation feedstock ("Work Plan"). The Work Plan is more fully  {E37 described}  in Exhibit A, which is hereby   {E38 incorporated}  by reference into this Development Agreement. CB1 that has been further  {E39 developed}  or  {E40 modified}  (or the like) under the Work  Plan shall be  {E41 referred}  to as "Modified CB1". Any changes to the Work Plan must be in writing and  {E42 signed}  by both Cargill and Bioamber and  may be subject to incremental fees  {E252 depending}  on resource requirements. 1.2 In  {E43 agreeing}  to  {E44 perform}  the Work Plan, Cargill  {E45 represents}  and warrants that:

  1.2.1 Cargill has the capability, experience, and means necessary to perform the Work Plan, and the Work Plan will be performed using  personnel, equipment, and material qualified and suitable to perform the Work Plan requested;

th

  1.2.2 Cargill will  {E47 provide}  properly  {E48 trained}  and  {E49 informed}  personnel, and Cargill will be solely responsible for the negligent acts, errors and  omissions of its employees, subcontractors, and agents and for any other person  {E50 performing}  services under this Development  Agreement at the direct request of Cargill;

  1.2.3 Cargill will  {E51 perform}  the Work Plan in a workmanlike manner with reasonable skill and care ordinarily  {E52 exercised}  by members of the  profession  {E53 practicing}  under similar conditions and in accordance with accepted industry practices and professional guidelines;

  1.2.4 Subject to Section 13.1, Cargill has in effect and will  {E54 maintain}  in effect all permits, licenses and other authorizations necessary to   {E55 perform}  the Work Plan; and



1.2.5 No other party has rights to its services as  {E56 described}  in the Work Plan, and that a work assignment from any third party shall not be   {E57 accepted}  , or work by Cargill aloneshall not be  {E58 conducted}  , to  {E59 develop}  CB1 or other microorganisms that will be  {E60 used}  to (a) directly   {E61 produce}  succinic acid and salts thereof, or (b) indirectly  {E62 produce}  succinic acid and salts thereof (for example, Cargill may  {E63 develop}   microorganisms to  {E64 produce}  precursors of succinic acid, such as fumaric acid and malic acid, so long as such precursors are not   {E65 converted}  to succinic acid, such as by chemical modification), for the  Term  (as  {E66 defined}  in Section 10.1) of this Development  Agreement. For purposes of clarity, and as examples, Cargill may  {E67 sell}  dextrose as fermentation feedstock to third parties, who may   {E68 use}  such dextrose to  {E69 produce}  succinic acid; also, Cargill may  {E70 modify}  starches to  {E71 make}  succinic acid starch derivatives. 2. Fees and Milestones   2.1 Bioamber shall  {E72 pay}  Cargill Two Hundred Fifty Thousand U.S. Dollars ($250,000.00) within thirty (30)  days  of the execution of this  Development Agreement. 2.2 In addition to the payment in Section 2.1, Bioamber shall  {E73 pay}  Cargill a total of [***] U.S. Dollars ($[***] per  year  per full-time equivalent  (FTE) person to  {E74 perform}  the Work Plan, and Cargill will  {E75 make}  available up to [***] FTE persons per  year  to  {E76 perform}  the work as  {E77 outlined}  in  the Work Plan. Such total is subject to change  {E78 based}  on an  annual  review of the needs and requirements of the Work Plan. The actual  number of FTEs  {E79 assigned}  at any  {E80 given}  time will be a function of the Work Plan and will be subject to agreement amongst the Parties. In  addition, Bioamber will  {E81 pay}  for reasonable expenses  {E82 incurred}  by Cargill,  {E83 including}  travel. Cargill shall  {E84 cover}  ordinary and customary [***]. Cargill shall  {E85 submit}  to Bioamber a  monthly  invoice for costs  {E86 owed}  by Bioamber,  {E87 accompanied}  by a report  {E88 summarizing}  Cargill's activities in  relation to actual hours  {E89 worked}  and expenses  {E90 incurred}  . Bioamber will  {E91 pay}  Cargill's costs within thirty (30)  days  of receipt of invoice and   {E92 supporting}  documentation. Bioamber shall have the right to  {E93 audit}  Cargill time sheets from time to time. Such audit shall  {E94 occur}   once per year   during reasonable business hours by an independent third party  {E95 agreed}  to by both parties, who shall be under obligations of  confidentiality. Cargill Confidential   - 3 -   * Confidential treatment  {E96 requested}  

2.3 Bioamber shall also  {E97 pay}  Cargill within thirty (30)  days  of  {E98 achieving}  each of the milestones  {E99 summarized}  below and more fully  {E100 described}  in the  Work Plan  {E101 found}  in Exhibit A. For purposes of clarity, payment is  {E102 triggered}  [***]. Further, each of the Milestones and Target Dates may be   {E103 changed}   {E104 according}  to the needs of the Work Plan and upon  {E105 written}  agreement by the parties. Milestone   Target  Date    Payment  Milestone 1: Proof of Concept    12 months  after Effective  Date    US $250,000.00 Milestone 2: CB1 Strain Development    30 months  after Effective  Date    US $300,000.00 Milestone 3: CB1 Strain Optimization    42 months  after Effective  Date    US $500,000.00

2.4 Missed Milestones. 2.4.1 In the event Cargill  {E106 does}  not  {E107 achieve}  a  {E108 given}  Milestone  {E109 provided}  in Section 2.3 by the Target  Date   {E110 listed}  in Section 2.3 or  {E111 modified}   Milestone and  {E112 modified}  Target  Date  as  {E113 agreed}  to by the Parties, and subsequently  {E114 achieves}  such milestone as per the criteria   {E115 described}  in Exhibit A, the payment for such  {E116 missed}  milestone shall be due [***] and the amount due shall be [***] for every [***]  beyond the Target  Date  . The Target  Date  for subsequent Milestones will be  {E117 adjusted}  to  {E118 reflect}  the date on which the Milestone was  actually  {E119 achieved}  . If a subsequent Milestone is  {E120 achieved}  by the original Target  Date   {E121 listed}  in Section 2.3, Bioamber will  {E122 pay}  Cargill  the amount [***]. For purposes of clarity and as examples, if Milestones 1 and 2 were not  {E123 delivered}  by the Target Dates, but  Milestone 3 is  {E124 delivered}  by or before the Target  Date  , then the total payments due to Cargill at that time would be [***] (a total  payment of $[***]). Another example is if [***], the payment due at that time would be a total of $[***]. 2.4.2 In the event Cargill  does  not  {E125 achieve}  a  {E126 given}  Milestone  {E127 provided}  in Section 2.3 by the Target  Date   {E128 listed}  in Section 2.3 or  {E129 modified}   Milestone and  {E130 modified}  Target  Date  as  {E131 agreed}  to by the Parties, and Bioamber  {E132 decides}  to  {E133 commercialize}  Modified CB1, any  outstanding milestone payments shall immediately  {E134 become}  due such that the total payment due Cargill under this Development  Agreement  {E135 equals}  One Million Fifty Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $1,050,000.00).

  2.4.3  {E137 Provided}  that Cargill has  {E138 respected}  its undertakings set out in Section 1.2 of this Development Agreement, no other damages shall  accrue to Cargill for not  {E139 achieving}  a  {E140 given}  Milestone other than  {E141 provided}  in Sections 2.4.1, 2.4.2, and 2.5. 2.5 Option to Research License. In the event Cargill (i) is unable to  {E142 achieve}  a  {E143 given}  milestone  {E144 described}  in Section 2.3 by the Target  Date  , or (ii)  terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.2, Bioamber shall have the option to  {E145 obtain}  a license during the  term  of this Development  Agreement to the patent applications and patents  {E146 listed}  in Exhibit B ( {E147 including}  any continuations,  {E148 continued}  prosecutions, continuations- in-part, reissues, reexaminations, divisions or substitutions thereof) (collectively "Licensed Patents"), the tool kit  {E149 listed}  in Exhibit C  ("Licensed Tool Kit"), and Cargill Improvements if any (as  {E150 defined}  in Section 5.2 below), for research use only and for additional monetary  consideration ("Research License"). Except for financial terms  {E151 paid}  by third parties for [***], the Research License shall be  {E152 offered}  to  Bioamber at [***]. Such research use shall be for the development and optimization of CB1 for the production of succinic acid and salts  thereof  {E153 using}  dextrose or sucrose as the fermentation feedstock. The Research License shall be  {E154 provided}  to Bioamber only, with no rights  to sublicense and with no "have  {E155 made}  " rights. Notwithstanding the  {E156 preceding}  , Bioamber will be  {E157 permitted}  to  {E158 outsource}  development work  as  {E159 outlined}  in the Work Plan and  {E160 according}  to the Research License to third parties that have been  {E161 approved}  by Cargill, and such approval  shall not be unreasonably  {E162 withheld}  . In  {E163 considering}  whether or not to  {E164 outsource}  such development work to third parties, the Parties   {E165 recognize}  that it is in their mutual interest to  {E166 protect}  CB1, Modified CB1, Cargill Confidential Information (as  {E167 defined}  in Section 4.1), and  Know-How and Licensed Patents (as those terms are  {E168 defined}  under the Commercial License Agreement) and, therefore, the Parties shall   {E169 undertake}  joint evaluations of third parties who have been  {E170 identified}  by Bioamber to  {E171 perform}  such development work,  {E172 including}  , for  example and not by limitation, a risk assessment of the geography in which such development work will  {E173 occur}  , and whether or not such  third parties have similar  {E174 guiding}  principles as Cargill (a copy of Cargill's Guiding Principles and Compliance Policy on Intellectual Property  is  {E175 attached}  as Exhibit F). Such development work shall not be  {E176 conducted}  by such third parties in circumstances where Cargill's intellectual  property is at an unacceptable risk as  {E177 determined}  by Cargill  {E178 based}  on the joint evaluations of such third parties. The terms and conditions  of such Research License shall be  {E179 negotiated}  between the Parties and shall  {E180 include}  the terms  {E181 described}  in this Section 2.5 and terms   {E182 addressing}  ownership and rights to use of any intellectual property  {E183 developed}  . Further, this Development Agreement shall  {E184 serve}  as the  framework for the Research License. 2.6 Technology Transfer. In the event Milestone 3 is  {E185 achieved}  , Cargill will  {E186 provide}  up to [***] to  {E187 assist}  in a successful transfer of the Modified  CB1 technology to Bioamber in order to  {E188 allow}  subsequent scale-up at the same FTE rate set forth in Section 2.2. For clarity, [***] per FTE  per  year   equals  US$[***] for this technology transfer). Cargill Confidential   - 5 -   * Confidential treatment  {E189 requested}  

2.7 Scale-Up.  {E190 Following}  the successful technology transfer, upon request by Bioamber and subject to Cargill's availability of appropriate  resources, Cargill will  {E191 enter}  at its sole discretion into a services agreement with Bioamber to  {E192 assist}  in the fermentation scale-up of  {E193 using}   Modified CB1  {E194 obtained}  under Milestones 2 and 3 for  {E195 producing}  succinic acid and salts thereof at a single Bioamber facility or a facility   {E196 designated}  by Bioamber. Cargill shall  {E197 invoice}  Bioamber [***] U.S. Dollars (US$[***]) per man- day   {E198 provided}  , not inclusive of taxes or other  governmental fees, and further  {E199 adjusted}  for inflation at the time it  {E200 goes}  into effect. Cargill shall have no obligation to  {E201 perform}  scale-up work  at Cargill facilities. 3. Alternative Feedstock. Bioamber also  {E202 desires}  the right to further  {E203 develop}  CB1 to  {E204 utilize}  cellulosic biomass as the fermentation feedstock. Cargill hereby  {E205 grants}  Bioamber the option to  {E206 modify}  or  {E207 convert}  the Work Plan to  {E208 include}  the development or modification of CB1 capable of   {E209 fermenting}  such cellulosic feedstock ("Modified Work Plan"). If such option is  {E210 exercised}  , (a) the terms and conditions of this Development  Agreement shall  {E211 apply}  to the Modified Work Plan except (i) new, additional up-front and milestone payments shall  {E212 apply}  as  {E213 provided}   below, and (ii) any development work  {E214 performed}  under the Modified Work Plan will be at a FTE rate which will be equivalent to the FTE rate   {E215 provided}  in Section 2.2 above and further  {E216 adjusted}  for inflation at the time it  {E217 goes}  into effect; and (b) the commercial license  {E218 attached}  as  Exhibit D shall be  {E219 expanded}  to  {E220 include}  the  {E221 resulting}  strain  {E222 developed}  out of the Modified Work Plan with no additional change in the  financial terms.
