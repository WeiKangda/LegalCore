Ladies and Gentlemen:

AFSALA  Bancorp,  Inc. (the  "Company") and Amsterdam  Federal Savings and Loan  Association,  a federally  chartered  mutual  savings and loan association  ("Association"),  with its deposit  accounts  {E5 insured}  by the Savings Association   Insurance  Fund  ("SAIF")   {E6 administered}   by  the  Federal  Deposit Insurance  Corporation  ("FDIC"),  hereby   {E7 confirm}  their  agreement with Capital Resources, Inc. ("Capital Resources") as  follows  :

SECTION 1. The Offering. The Association,  in accordance with and pursuant to its plan of conversion   {E8 adopted}  by the Board of Directors of the Association  (the "Plan"),   {E9 intends}  to be  {E10 converted}   from a  federally- {E11 chartered}  mutual savings and loan association to a federally- {E12 chartered}   stock savings bank and will   {E13 sell}  all of its   {E14 issued}   and  outstanding  stock to the  Company. The Company  will   {E15 offer}   and   {E16 sell}  its  common  stock  (the  "Common  Stock")  in a subscription  offering  ("Subscription  Offering") to (1) tax  {E17 qualified}  employee benefit plans of the Association,  (2) depositors of the Association as of  March 31, 1995  ("Eligible Account  Holders"),  (3) depositors of the Association as of  June 30, 1996   ("Supplemental  Eligible  Account  Holders"),  (4) certain  other deposit  account  holders  and  borrower  members  of  the  Association  ("Other Members") and (5) to its employees,  officers and directors,  pursuant to rights to  subscribe  for shares of Common Stock (the  "Shares"). Subject to the prior subscription rights of the above- {E18 listed}   parties, the Company may  {E19 offer}  for sale in a public offering (the "Public  Offering," and when  {E20 referred}  to together with the Subscription  Offering,  the "Subscription and Public Offerings")   {E21 conducted}  after the Subscription  Offering, the Shares not so subscribed for or  {E22 ordered}  in the  Subscription  Offering  to the  general  public  (all such  offerees  being  {E23 referred}  to in the aggregate as "Eligible Offerees"). Shares may also be  {E24 sold}  in the Public Offering by a selling group of  broker-dealers   {E25 organized}  and  {E26 managed}  by Capital  Resources. It is   {E27 acknowledged}   that the  purchase of Shares in the Subscription  and Public  Offerings  is subject to maximum and minimum  purchase limitations as  {E28 described}  in the Plan and that the Company may  {E29 reject}  in whole or in part any subscriptions  {E30 received}  from subscribers in the Public Offering. The  Company  and the  Association  desire to  retain  Capital Resources to  {E33 assist}  the Company with its sale of the Shares in the  Subscription and Public  Offerings. By and  through  this  Agreement,  the  Company  and the Association  {E32 confirm}  the retention of Capital Resources to  {E33 assist}  the Company and the Association during the Subscription and Public Offerings. The  Company  has   {E34 filed}   with  the  Securities  and  Exchange Commission  (the  "Commission")  a registration  statement on Form S-l (File No. 333-6399)   containing  an offering  prospectus   relating  to the  Subscription and Public  Offerings for the registration of the Shares under the Securities Act of  1933 , as  {E35 amended}  (the " 1933  Act"),  and has  {E36 filed}  such  amendments  thereto,  if any, and such  {E37 amended}   prospectuses as may have been  {E38 required}  to the date hereof (the  "Registration  Statement"). The prospectus,  as  {E39 amended}  ,   {E40 included}  in the Registration   Statement  at  the  time  it  initially   {E41 becomes}   effective,   is hereinafter  {E42 called}  the "Offering  Prospectus",  except that if any prospectus is  {E43 filed}  by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the  1933  Act (the " 1933  Act Regulations")  differing  from the offering  prospectus   {E44 included}  in the Registration  Statement at the time it initially  {E45 becomes}  effective,  the  term  " Offering   Prospectus" shall  {E46 refer}  to the offering prospectus  {E47 filed}  pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) from and after the time  {E48 said}   offering  prospectus is  {E49 filed}  with or  {E50 mailed}  to the Commission for filing. In accordance  with Title 12, Part 563b of the Code of Federal Regulations (the "Conversion  Regulations"),  the Association has  {E51 filed}  with the Office  of Thrift  Supervision  (the  "OTS")  an  Application  for  Approval  of Conversion  on Form AC (the  "Conversion  Application")   including   the Offering

Prospectus  and has  {E52 filed}   such  amendments  thereto,  if any,  as may have been  {E53 required}  by the OTS. The  Conversion  Application  has been  {E54 approved}  by the OTS. The Company has  {E55 filed}  with the OTS its application on Form H-(e)lS (the "Holding Company  Application")  to  {E56 acquire}  the  Association  under the Home Owners' Loan Act, as  {E57 amended}  (12 U.S.C. ss. 1467a) ("HOLA"). SECTION 2. Retention of Capital Resources;  Compensation; Sale and  Delivery  of the  Shares. Subject to the terms and  conditions  herein set forth, the Company and the Association hereby  {E58 appoint}  Capital Resources as their agent to  {E59 advise}  and  {E60 assist}  the Company and the  Association  with the  Company's sale of the Shares in the Subscription and Public Offerings. On  the  basis  of  the   representations,   warranties,   and agreements herein  {E61 contained}  ,  but subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, Capital Resources  {E62 accepts}  such appointment and  {E63 agrees}  to  {E64 consult}  with and  {E59 advise}  the Company and the Association as to matters   relating  to the Conversion and the Subscription and Public Offerings. It is  {E66 acknowledged}  by the Company and the  Association  that Capital  Resources  shall not be  {E67 required}  to  {E68 purchase}  any Shares and shall not be  {E69 obligated}  to  {E70 take}  any action which is inconsistent  with any  applicable  laws,  regulations,  decisions  or orders. If  {E71 requested}  by the Company or the  Association,  Capital  Resources  also may  {E72 assemble}  and  {E73 manage}  a selling group of broker dealers which are members of the National Association of Securities  Dealers,  Inc. (the "NASD") to   {E74 participate}  in the  solicitation  of purchase  orders  for  Shares  under a  {E75 selected}   dealers'  agreement  ("Selected Dealers'  Agreement"). The  obligations of Capital  Resources  pursuant to this Agreement  shall   {E76 terminate}  upon the completion or termination or abandonment of the  Plan  by  the  Company  or  the  Association  or  upon  termination  of the Subscription  and  Public  Offerings,  or if the  terms  of the  Conversion  are substantially   {E77 amended}   so as to  materially  and  adversely   {E78 change}  the role of Capital  Resources,  but in no event later than  45 days  after the  completion of the Subscription and Public Offerings (the "End  Date  "). All fees due to Capital Resources  but unpaid will be {E1 payable} to Capital  Resources in  next day  funds at the earlier of the Closing  Date  (as hereinafter  {E79 defined}  ) or the End  Date  . In the event the  Subscription  and Public  Offerings are  {E80 extended}  beyond the End  Date  , the Company, the

-2-

Association  and Capital  Resources may mutually   {E81 agree}  to  {E82 renew}  this  Agreement under mutually acceptable terms. In the event  the  Company  is  unable  to  {E83 sell}  a  minimum  of 935,000  Shares  within  the  period  herein   {E84 provided}  ,   this  Agreement  shall  {E85 terminate}  ,  and the Company shall  {E86 refund}  to any persons who have   {E87 subscribed}  for any of the Shares,  the full amount  which it may have   {E88 received}   from them plus  {E89 accrued}   interest  as set  forth  in the  Offering  Prospectus;  and none of the parties  to this  Agreement  shall  have any  obligation  to the  other  parties hereunder,  except as set forth in this  Section 2 and in  Sections  7, 9 and 10 hereof. In the event the closing   does  not  {E90 occur}  ,  the  Conversion  is  {E91 terminated}   or  otherwise   {E92 abandoned}  ,   or  the  terms  of  the  Conversion  are substantially   {E93 amended}   so as to  materially  and  adversely   {E94 change}  the role of Capital  Resources,  Capital  Resources  shall be  {E95 reimbursed}   for all reasonable legal fees and  out-of-pocket  expenses for   rendering   financial  advice to the Association   concerning  the structure of the Conversion,   preparing  a market and financial analysis,  performing  due diligence and assisting in the preparation of the Application for Conversion and the  Registration  Statement,  which shall be  {E96 paid}  upon such termination, abandonment or amendment or within  five days  of such event. If  all  conditions  precedent  to  the  consummation  of  the Conversion,   including  ,  without limitation,  the sale of all Shares  {E97 required}  by the Plan to be  {E98 sold}  , are  satisfied,  the Company  {E99 agrees}  to  {E100 issue}  or have  {E101 issued}  the Shares   {E98 sold}  in the  Subscription  and Public  Offerings  and to  {E103 release}  for delivery   {E104 certificates}   for such  Shares  on the  Closing   Date  (as  hereinafter  {E105 defined}  )  against  payment to the Company by any means  authorized  by the Plan, provided,  however, that no certificates shall be released for such shares until the  conditions  specified in Section 7 hereof shall have been  complied with to the reasonable satisfaction of Capital Resources and its counsel. The release of Shares against payment  therefor shall be  {E106 made}  on a date and at a time and place acceptable to the Company, the Association and Capital Resources. The date upon which the Company shall   {E107 release}  or  {E108 deliver}  the Shares  {E98 sold}  in the  Subscription and Public Offerings,  in accordance with the terms hereof, is herein  {E110 called}  the "Closing  Date  ."
