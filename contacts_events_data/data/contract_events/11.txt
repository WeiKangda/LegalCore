Ladies and Gentlemen:

         Alamogordo   Financial   Corporation,   a  federal   corporation   (the "Company"), AF Mutual Holding Company (the "MHC") and Alamogordo Federal Savings and Loan Association,  a federally  chartered stock savings and loan association (the  "Bank")  with its  deposit  accounts   insured  by the  Savings  Association Insurance  Fund  ("SAIF")    administered   by  the  Federal   Deposit   Insurance Corporation  ("FDIC"),  hereby confirm,  jointly and severally,  their agreement with Charles Webb & Company,  a Division of Keefe,  Bruyette & Woods,  Inc. (the "Agent"), as  follows  :

         Section 1. The  Offering. In accordance  with the Stock  Issuance Plan  adopted  by its Board of Directors (the "Plan"),  the Company will  offer  and  sell  up to  1,101,643  shares of its common  stock,  par  value,  $.01 per share (the "Shares" or "Common  Stock"),  in a  subscription  offering  (the  "Subscription Offering") to (1) depositors of the Bank with account balances of $50.00 or more as of  September 30, 1998  ("Eligible  Account  Holders"),  (2) the Employee Stock Ownership Plan of the Bank (the "ESOP"), (3) depositors of the Bank with account balances  of $50.00 or more as of   December  31,  1999   ("Supplemental  Eligible Account Holders"), and (4) employees, officers and directors of the Bank. To the extent  Shares   remain   unsold in the  Subscription  Offering,  the  Company  is  offering  for sale in a community  offering  (the  "Community  Offering" and when  referred  to together  with the  Subscription  Offering,  the  "Subscription  and Community  Offering")  the  Shares  not  so   subscribed   for or   ordered   in the Subscription  Offering  to members of the general public, with preference  given  to natural persons  residing  in the New Mexico counties of Otero and Lincoln

("Other Subscribers"),  (all such offerees being  referred  to in the aggregate as "Eligible  Offerees"). It is  anticipated   that shares not  subscribed  for in the Subscription  and Community  Offering will be  offered  to certain  members of the general  public on a best efforts basis through a  selected   dealers  arrangement (the "Syndicated  Community  Offering") (the  Subscription  Offering,  Community Offering and Syndicated  Community Offering are collectively   referred  to as the "Offering"). It is  acknowledged   that the purchase of Shares in the Offering is subject to the maximum and minimum purchase limitations as  described  in the Plan and that the Company and the Bank may   reject  ,  in whole or in part,  any orders  received  in the Community Offering or Syndicated Community Offering. The Company will   issue  the Shares at a  purchase  price of $10.00 per share (the  "Purchase Price"). The Company has  filed  with the Securities and Exchange  Commission (the "Commission")  a  registration  statement  on Form  S-1  (File  No. 333- ) (the "Registration  Statement")   containing  a prospectus  relating  to the Offering for the  registration  of the  Shares  under the  Securities  Act of  1933  (the " 1933  Act"),  and has  filed  such amendments  thereof and such  amended   prospectuses as may have been   required  to the date hereof. The  term   "Registration  Statement" shall   include   all   exhibits   thereto,  as   amended  ,   including   post-effective amendments. The prospectus, as  amended  , on file with the Commission at the time the Registration  Statement initially  became  effective is hereinafter  called  the "Prospectus,"  except that if any Prospectus is  filed  by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the  1933  Act (the " 1933  Act  Regulations")   differing   from the prospectus on file at the time  the  Registration   Statement   initially   becomes   effective,   the   term  "Prospectus"  shall  refer  to the prospectus  filed  pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) from and after the time  said  prospectus is  filed  with the Commission. In accordance  with Title 12, Parts 575 and 563b of the Code of Federal Regulations  (the "MHC  Regulations"),  the Company has  filed  with the Office of Thrift  Supervision (the "OTS") an Application on Form MHC-2 with respect to the stock  issuance  (the  "MHC  Application"),   including   the  Prospectus  and the Valuation  Appraisal Report  prepared  by RP Financial,  LC (the  "Appraisal") and has  filed  such amendments  thereto as may have been  required  by the OTS. The MHC Application  has been   approved  by the OTS and the related  Prospectus  has been  authorized  for use by the OTS. Section 2.

Subject to the terms and conditions  herein set forth,  the Company and the Bank have  retained  the Agent to  consult  with and to  advise  the Bank, the MHC and the Company,  and to  assist  the Company,  on a best  efforts  basis,  in the distribution  of the shares of Common Stock in the  Offering.
