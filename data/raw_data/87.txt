COLLABORATION AGREEMENT

THIS AGREEMENT is  {E5 made}  this 1st  day  of  April ,  2007  ("Effective  Date  "), by and between INSTITUTE OF GRASSLAND AND  ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH ("IGER"), a company  {E6 limited}  by guarantee,  {E7 registered}  in England No. 473456 and a  {E8 registered}  Charity No. 272150,   having  an office at Plas Gogerddan, Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, SY23 3EB, United Kingdom and CERES, INC. ("CERES"), a Delaware corporation,   having  an office at  1535  Rancho Conejo Blvd., Thousand Oaks, California 91320, United States of America. WHEREAS, the Parties  {E9 wish}  to  {E10 establish}  a research program for  {E11 undertaking}  specific, collaborative {E236 projects} after the Effective  Date  , to further the  scientific research and commercial objectives of CERES as well as the scientific research objectives of IGER;

WHEREAS, the research {E229 programs}  {E12 contemplated}  by this Agreement and its schedules are consistent with and in furtherance of IGER research  {E230 programs};

WHEREAS, CERES and IGER  {E13 recognize}  that rights to intellectual property  {E14 conceived}  or  {E15 reduced}  to  {E16 practice}  in the {E231 performance} of the Parties'  {E233 collaboration} can be a strong incentive for CERES to  {E17 risk}  money and other resources  {E18 needed}  to  {E19 develop}  proprietary products for wide  {E232 commercialization};

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants and agreements  {E20 contained}  herein and of other good and  valuable consideration, the Parties have  {E21 agreed}  and  do  hereby  {E22 agree}  as  follows  :

1.1 CERES and IGER  {E23 anticipate}  that from time to time they may  {E24 undertake}  and  {E25 conduct}  certain joint and collaborative {E236 research projects}  (individually a "{E238 RESEARCH PROJECT}" and collectively "{E236 RESEARCH PROJECTS}"). The Parties  {E26 acknowledge}  and  {E27 agree}  that the {E236 RESEARCH  PROJECTS} will  {E28 involve}  the contributions, whether financial or otherwise, of both Parties. The specific terms and respective obligations of the  Parties for each {E238 RESEARCH PROJECT} will be  {E29 negotiated}  by the Parties and  {E30 reflected}  in a schedule ("SCHEDULE")  {E31 signed}  by authorized  representatives of both Parties. Any such fully  {E32 executed}  SCHEDULE shall  {E33 become}  a part of this Agreement and subject to the terms of this  Agreement. Each Party shall diligently  {E34 perform}  its {E239 activities} in any  {E35 given}  {E238 RESEARCH PROJECT}. 1.2 All rights in property, tangible or intangible,  {E36 used}  in the {E236 RESEARCH PROJECTS} shall  {E37 remain}  with the Party  {E38 providing}  such property, unless  otherwise  {E39 agreed}  between the Parties in this Agreement, a SCHEDULE or a separate agreement. 1.3 {E236 RESEARCH PROJECTS} will  {E40 relate}  to crop species  {E41 defined}  in EXHIBIT A to this Agreement ("COLLABORATION CROPS"). 1.4 Each SCHEDULE will at least  {E42 contain}  the following:
