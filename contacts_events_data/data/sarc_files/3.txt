Ladies and Gentlemen:

Greater Delaware Valley Holdings, A Mutual Company, a Pennsylvania- {E1 chartered}  mutual  holding  company (the "PA MHC"), Alliance Mutual Holding Company, a federal mutual savings and loan  holding  company in formation (the "Federal MHC"), Alliance Bancorp, Inc. of Pennsylvania, a federal stock  holding  company in formation (the "Company"), and Greater Delaware Valley Savings Bank d/b/a Alliance Bank, a Pennsylvania- {E2 chartered}  stock savings bank (the "Bank"), hereby  {E3 confirm}  their agreement with Sandler O'Neill & Partners, L.P. ("Sandler O'Neill" or the "Agent") with respect to the offer and sale by the Company of up to 2,445,223 shares (subject to increase to up to 2,812,006 shares in the event of an increase in the pro forma market value of the Company's common stock) of the Company's common stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Common Stock"). The shares of Common Stock to be  {E4 sold}  by the Company in the Offerings (as  defined  below) are hereinafter  {E5 called}  the "Securities."

The PA MHC and the Bank have  {E6 determined}  to  {E7 undertake}  a reorganization pursuant to which the Company will be  {E8 created}  as a mid-tier  holding  company, the outstanding capital stock of the Bank will be  {E9 exchanged}  for shares of the Common Stock, and the PA MHC will  {E10 convert}  from a Pennsylvania- {E11 chartered}  mutual  holding  company to a federally-chartered mutual  holding  company under the name Alliance Mutual Holding Company, all in accordance with the Agreement and Plan

1

th





of Reorganization,  dated  as of  June 21, 2006 , as may be  {E12 amended}  from time to time pursuant to the terms thereof. Concurrently therewith, the Securities are being  {E13 offered}  for sale in the Offerings (as  defined  below) in accordance with the Plan of Additional Stock Issuance  dated   June 21, 2006  as may be  {E14 amended}  from time to time pursuant to the terms thereof. The Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and the Plan of Additional Stock Issuance are hereinafter  {E15 referred}  to collectively as the "Plans." The PA MHC and Federal MHC are hereinafter  {E16 referred}  to collectively as the "MHCs."

Pursuant to the Plans, the Company will  {E17 offer}  to certain depositors of the Bank and to the Bank's tax  qualified  employee benefit plans,  including  the Bank's employee stock ownership plan (the "ESOP") (collectively, the "Employee Plans"), rights to  {E18 subscribe}  for the Securities in a subscription offering (the "Subscription Offering"). To the extent Securities are not  {E19 subscribed}  for in the Subscription Offering, such Securities may be  {E20 offered}  to certain members of the general public and to other persons in a community offering (the "Community Offering"), with preference  {E21 given}  first to natural persons and trusts of natural persons  residing  in Delaware and Chester Counties, Pennsylvania and then to the Bank's stockholders as of ___________,  2006 . The Community Offering, which together with the Subscription Offering, as  each may  be  {E22 extended}  or  {E23 reopened}  from time to time, is herein  {E24 referred}  to as the "Subscription and Community Offering," may be  {E25 commenced}  concurrently with, during or after, the Subscription Offering. It is  currently   {E26 anticipated}  that any Securities not  {E27 subscribed}  for in the Subscription and Community Offering will be  {E28 offered}  , subject to Section 2 hereof, in a  {E29 syndicated}  community offering (the "Syndicated Community Offering"). The Subscription and Community Offering and the Syndicated Community Offering are hereinafter  {E30 referred}  to collectively as the "Offerings." The conversion of the PA MHC from a state- {E31 chartered}  mutual  holding  company to a federally-chartered mutual  holding  company, the formation of the Company, the exchange of the capital stock of the Bank for capital stock of the Company and the Offerings are hereinafter  {E32 referred}  to collectively as the "Reorganization and Additional Stock Issuance." As a result of the Reorganization and Additional Stock Issuance, the Bank, which is  currently  80.02%  {E33 owned}  by the PA MHC, will  {E34 become}  a wholly- {E35 owned}  subsidiary of the Company and the Company will be 55%  {E36 owned}  by the Federal MHC. The Securities may be  {E37 offered}  to the general public in a public offering (the "Public Offering") in lieu of or subsequent to the Syndicated Community Offering. If there is a Public Offering, the Public Offering will be  {E38 governed}  by a separate definitive purchase agreement as  {E39 described}  in Section 2 hereof. It is  {E40 acknowledged}  that the number of Securities to be  {E41 sold}  in the Offerings may be  {E42 increased}  or  {E43 decreased}  in accordance with the Plans. If the number of Securities is  {E44 increased}  or  {E45 decreased}  , the  term  "Securities" shall mean such greater or lesser number, where applicable. In the event that a mid-tier  holding  company form of organization is not  {E46 utilized}  , all pertinent terms of this Agreement will  {E47 apply}  to the sale of the Bank's common stock. The Company has  {E48 filed}  with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-  136853 ),  including  a related prospectus, for the registration of the Securities under the Securities Act of  1933 , as  {E49 amended}  (the "Securities Act"), has  {E50 filed}  such amendments  thereto  , if any, and such  {E51 amended}  prospectuses as may have been  {E52 required}  to the date hereof by the Commission in order to  {E53 declare}  such registration statement effective, and will  {E54 file}  such additional amendments thereto and such  {E55 amended}  prospectuses and prospectus supplements as may hereafter be  {E56 required}  . Such registration statement (as  {E57 amended}  to date, if applicable, and as from time to time  {E58 amended}  or  {E59 supplemented}  hereafter) and the prospectuses  constituting  a part thereof ( including  in each case all documents  {E60 incorporated}  or  {E61 deemed}  to be  {E62 incorporated}  by reference

therein and the information, if any,  {E63 deemed}  to be a part thereof pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Securities Act, as from time to time  {E64 amended}  or  {E65 supplemented}  pursuant to the Securities Act or otherwise (the "Securities Act Regulations")), are hereinafter  {E66 referred}  to as the "Registration Statement" and the "Prospectus," respectively, except that if any  {E67 revised}  prospectus shall be  {E68 used}  by the Company in connection with the Subscription and Community Offering or the Syndicated Community Offering which  {E69 differs}  from the Prospectus on file at the Commission at the time the Registration Statement  {E70 becomes}  effective (whether or not such  {E71 revised}  prospectus is  {E72 required}  to be  {E73 filed}  by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act Regulations), the  term  "Prospectus" shall  {E74 refer}  to such  {E75 revised}  prospectus from and after the time it is first  {E76 provided}  to the Agent for such use. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Company is  delivering  to the Agent copies of the Prospectus of the Company to be  {E77 used}  in the Offerings.
