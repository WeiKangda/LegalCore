WHEREAS, the Board has  {E8 determined}  that it is in the best interests of the Company to  {E9 appoint}  the ValueAct Designee on the terms set forth in this Agreement. NOW, THEREFORE, In consideration of and reliance upon the mutual covenants and agreements  {E10 contained}  herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the {E210 receipt} and sufficiency of which is hereby  {E11 acknowledged}  , the parties hereto  {E12 agree}  as  {E13 follows}  :

If the ValueAct Designee is  {E214 appointed}  to the Board pursuant to this Section 1(a), the Company shall  {E24 include}  the ValueAct Designee as a Class I Director, which  term   {E25 expires}  at the Company's  2016   annual  meeting of stockholders.

The ValueAct Designee will promptly  {E36 advise}  the Nominating Committee if he  {E37 ceases}  to  {E38 satisfy}  any of the Conditions. (d) At all times while  serving  as a member of the Board, the ValueAct Designee shall  {E39 comply}  with all policies, procedures, processes, codes, rules, standards and guidelines applicable to Board members,  including  the Company's Code of Business Conduct, Insider Trading Policy, Executive Stock Ownership Policy as in effect on the date hereof, and Corporate Governance Guidelines, and (except as  {E40 permitted}  by the Confidentiality Agreement (as  {E41 defined}  in Section 7 below))  {E42 preserve}  the confidentiality of Company business and information,  including  {E218 discussions} or matters  {E43 considered}  in {E219 meetings} of the Board or Board committees to the extent not  {E44 disclosed}  publicly by the Company. 1





(e) So long as the ValueAct Group collectively beneficially  {E45 owns}  , in the aggregate, at least 7.5% of the outstanding Common Stock, if, during the Covered Period, a vacancy on the Board is  {E46 created}  as a result of the ValueAct Designee's death, resignation, disqualification or removal, then the ValueAct Group and the Company ( acting  through the Board) shall  {E47 work}  together in good faith to  {E48 fill}  such vacancy or  {E49 replace}  such nominee with an individual who (A)  {E50 meets}  the Conditions, (B)  {E51 meets}  the historical standards and criteria  {E52 applied}  by the Company in  nominating  and  appointing  directors, and (C) is otherwise mutually acceptable (in each of their sole discretion) to the ValueAct Group and the Company, and thereafter such individual shall  {E53 serve}  and/or be  {E54 nominated}  as the "ValueAct Designee" under this Agreement. (f) The Company's obligations hereunder shall  {E55 terminate}  immediately, and the ValueAct Designee shall promptly  {E56 offer}  to  {E57 resign}  from the Board, and any committee of the Board on which he then  {E58 sits}  (and, if  {E59 requested}  by the Company, promptly  {E60 deliver}  his  {E61 written}  resignation to the Board (which shall  {E62 provide}  for his immediate resignation) it being  {E63 understood}  that it shall be in the Board's sole discretion whether to  {E64 accept}  or  {E65 reject}  such resignation) if: (i) members of the ValueAct Group, collectively,  {E66 cease}  to beneficially own at least 7.5% of the Company's outstanding Common Stock; (ii) the ValueAct Designee  {E67 ceases}  to  {E68 satisfy}  the conditions set forth in clauses (c)-(d) above; (iii) a member of the ValueAct Group,  including  the ValueAct Designee, otherwise  {E69 ceases}  to  {E70 comply}  or  {E71 breaches}  any of the terms of this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement; or (iv) the employment of the ValueAct Designee with the ValueAct Group is  {E72 terminated}  for any reason. The ValueAct Group  {E73 agrees}  to  {E74 cause}  the ValueAct Designee to  {E75 resign}  from the Board if the ValueAct Designee  {E76 fails}  to  {E77 resign}  if and when  {E78 requested}  pursuant to this Section 1(f). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of the occurrence of an event set forth in subsection (ii) or (iv) above, the provisions of Section 1(e) must be  {E79 complied}  with before the Company's obligations hereunder may  {E80 terminate}  .
