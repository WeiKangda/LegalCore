If Distributor  {E114 fails}  to  {E115 provide}  S2K with comments within one business  day  , the $250 expedited review {E257 charge} will not  {E116 apply}  . 3. Performance Requirements.

The  term  of this Agreement shall  {E122 commence}  on the Effective  Date  and shall  {E129 end}  on the 60th  day   {E124 following}  a  {E125 written}  notice from one party to the other of its {E273 decision} to  {E126 terminate}  this Agreement at the end of such  60-day period  or upon {E274 termination} of the applicable Distribution Agreement with respect to a Fund. {E275 Termination} of this Agreement as to a Fund shall not  {E127 terminate}  this Agreement with respect to any other Fund so long as such other Fund's (or Funds', as the case may be) Distribution Agreement is effective.
