1.2  CNET. CNET  {E20 produces}  television programs and  {E21 operates}  a network of           Internet sites on the world wide web. For purposes of this Agreement,           the "CNET Sites"  {E22 refer}  to any Internet sites  {E23 operated}  by CNET or its           subsidiaries,  {E24 including}  without limitation the sites  {E25 referenced}  in           Section 2.5 and Exhibit A. 2.

For such purposes, a                  "Retail {E239 Impression}" means the display of one page of a CNET                  Site that  {E42 contains}  at least one Retail Promotion. If CNET  {E43 fails}                   to  {E35 provide}  the Retail Impressions  {E45 required}  by the  {E46 preceding}                   sentence during the  Term  , then CNET will  {E47 continue}  to  {E48 display}                   Retail {E239 Impressions} in accordance with this Agreement  {E49 following}                   the  Term  (notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the                   Term  ) until the  {E50 required}  number of Retail {E239 Impressions} has been                   {E51 delivered}  . 2.4  Placement of Retail Promotions. CNET will  {E52 determine}  the location and           type of each Retail Promotion  {E53 displayed}  throughout the CNET Sites and           may  {E54 phase}  in certain types of Retail Promotions as they are  {E55 developed}  . CNET  currently   {E56 intends}  to  {E60 display}  Retail Promotions  {E58 consisting}  of           text/HTML links,  {E224 pre   -   filled}  with an appropriate query string or link           ("Pre- Filled  Links"), as set forth in this Section. The Retail           Promotions  {E59 contemplated}  by this Section will be  {E60 displayed}  above the            {E61 fold}  where the graphical layout of the page reasonably  {E62 permits}  such           positioning (as  {E63 determined}  by CNET), and in other cases the Retail           Promotions will be prominently  {E64 positioned}  below the fold. For the           purposes of clarity, the "fold" is  {E65 defined}  as the visible portion of           the screen on a standard 640 x 480 screen size. 2.4.1  On SEARCH.COM, CNET  {E66 intends}  to  {E67 display}  a {E224 Pre- Filled}  Link on the

The Company will  {E77 design}            any graphics  {E78 required}  for the Online Promotions and  {E79 provide}  pre-filled           query strings or links for all of the {E224 Pre- Filled}  Links, with           reasonable {E247 assistance} from CNET, and the Company will  {E80 supply}  digital           copies of such graphics and other materials to CNET. CNET will be           responsible for  {E81 incorporating}  the Online Promotions into the CNET           Sites and for  {E82 ensuring}  that the Online Promotions are accessible to           users of the CNET Sites ("Users"). 2.6  Reporting. Within  30 days  after the end of  each month  during the  Term  ,           CNET will  {E83 provide}  a report to the Company  {E84 indicating}  the number of           Retail Promotions  {E85 displayed}  on the CNET Sites during such  month  and           the number of times that a User  {E86 clicked}  on a Retail Promotion during           such  month  . CNET will also  {E87 provide}  standard  {E88 reporting}  for banner           advertisements and television Promotions. 3. The Company's Obligations:

3.1  Operation of Company Site. The Company will be responsible for            {E89 ensuring}  that each link  {E90 embedded}  within an Online Promotion  {E91 takes}  the           User to the appropriate area within the Company Site, and that the           Company Site  {E92 functions}  with reasonable reliability and in a           commercially reasonable manner throughout the  Term  . In particular, the           Company  {E93 agrees}  that the Company Site will  {E94 comply}  with the performance           standards set forth in Exhibit B throughout the  Term  . Any {E248 failure} by           the Company to  {E95 comply}  with this paragraph will be  {E96 deemed}  to be a           material {E249 breach} of this Agreement. 3.2  Reporting. Within  30 days  after the end of  each month  during the  Term  ,           the Company will  {E97 provide}  a {E272 report} to CNET  {E98 indicating}  the aggregate           number of {E250 referrals} from the CNET Sites to the Company Site during           such  month  , the  {E99 resulting}  number of buyers, the aggregate {E251 behavior}           ( {E100 including}  orders and sales volume) of those buyers, and the total           revenue attributable to the Online Promotions minus applicable sales           tax, shipping costs, {E252 returns} and {E253 cancellations} (the "CNET Sales"). The           "CNET Sales" will be  {E101 counted}  as {E254 sales} by the Company to each User who            {E102 accesses}  the Company Site through a link from an Online Promotion for           a period of  4 hours  from the {E255 referral}, CNET and The Company will  {E103 agree}            on technical procedures to  {E104 allow}  the easy and accurate {E259 reporting} of           CNET Sales. The Company will  {E105 make}  this information available in a           manner which

{E106 allows}  CNET and the Company to  {E107 understand}  the {E257 performance} of the           various Online Promotions. 3.3  Cash Consideration. 3.3.1  For  each month  during the  Term  , the Company will  {E261 pay}  CNET a                  minimum of [XXXX] in cash, plus [XXX] of CNET Sales. {E273 Payments}                  under this paragraph will be  {E109 based}  on the {E259 reports}  {E110 prepared}  by                  the Company under Section 3.2 (although CNET may  {E111 challenge}  such                  {E259 reports} as  {E112 contemplated}  by Section 9.5) and will be due within                   30 days  after the end of  each month  of the  Term  . 3.3.2  {E261 Payments} under this Section 3.3 will be  {E113 made}  by wire transfer                  of immediately available funds and are nonrefundable once  {E261 paid}  . 3.4  User Information. At least once each calendar  quarter  , the Company           will  {E115 deliver}  to CNET all aggregate data  {E116 collected}  as a result of the           CNET Sales,  {E117 including}  but not  {E118 limited}  to, demographic data,  {E119 buying}            {E262 behavior} as  {E120 measured}  by {E263 conversion} to {E264 sale}, frequency of {E265 purchasing},           average order size, and a comparison to the respective average for the           Company. 3.5  Reciprocal Marketing.

CNET will  {E130 provide}  all entry forms and  {E131 operate}  the           {E269 production} and {E270 sending} of the newsletter. CNET  {E132 agrees}  not to           specifically  {E133 target}  these subscribers separately from the general

database of subscribers to CNET's various newsletters.

If      this Agreement is  {E151 terminated}  during any of  the three month  periods       {E152 referenced}  in Section 2.3.2, then the  {E153 required}  number of Retail {E239 Impressions}      applicable thereunder to such  three   will be pro  month  period {E154 rated}       accordingly. 5.

The Retail Promotions  {E169 granted}  to      the Company shall be  {E170 placed}  in such a way as to  {E171 provide}  no more or less      prominence to the Company than is  {E172 provided}  to any other Competing Computer      Retailer  {E173 signing}  an agreement with CNET. 6.
