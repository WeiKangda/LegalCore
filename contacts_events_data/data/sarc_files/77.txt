Appointment  Subject to {E244 payment} of the Annual Minimum Commitment ("AMC"  -  {E22 defined}  herein), Diversinet hereby grants to Reseller an exclusive, non- transferable and non-assignable right to market,  {E23 sell}  , and sub- {E24 license}  those Diversinet products  {E25 listed}  in Schedule 2 (the "Products") within the  territory  {E26 listed}  in Schedule 3 (the "Territory") to Canadian  {E27 headquartered}  companies, and governmental and broader public sector entities  {E28 located}   in Canada. Reseller's customers (the "Customers") are  {E29 defined}  as those organizations/enterprises that will  {E30 market}  and  {E31 manage}  the end-users of the  Products (the "End-Users"). Reseller  {E32 acknowledges}  and  {E33 agrees}  that it  does  not have the right to  {E34 assign}  sub-resellers under this Agreement  outside of the Territory, except with the prior  {E35 written}  consent of Diversinet. Furthermore, if Reseller  {E36 terminates}  the AMC in the manner  {E37 contemplated}  in Schedule 3, the exclusive license above shall  {E38 revert}  to being a non- exclusive license. In either case, Reseller will have the non-exclusive right to  {E39 contract}  in the rest of the world,  {E40 excluding}  the United States. If Reseller  {E41 identifies}  End- Users in the United States, with the prior  {E42 written}  consent of Diversinet, Reseller may  {E43 sell}  the Products to the End-Users. United Stated revenues  will not be  {E44 counted}  against the AMC however Reseller will be  {E45 entitled}  to the discount rates as  {E46 indicated}  in Schedule 3.. In addition, Diversinet hereby grants to Reseller the right to  {E247 use}  those Diversinet trademarks and  {E51 copyrighted}  materials with respect to the  Products solely for the purpose of {E245 marketing} and {E246 distribution} of the Products as  {E49 authorized}  hereunder. Reseller  {E50 acknowledges}  that the {E247 use} of such  trademarks and  {E51 copyrighted}  materials  does  not  {E52 create}  in its favour any right, whether of ownership or otherwise, to such trade-marks and   {E51 copyrighted}  materials, and that all rights  {E54 arising}  from the {E247 use}  {E55 thereof}  by Reseller shall  {E56 inure}  to the benefit of Diversinet. Reseller  {E57 agrees}  that the rights  {E58 granted}  to Reseller in this Section 1 are solely for the purpose of  {E59 supplying}  the Products to Reseller, its Customers  and End-Users  {E60 located}  in the Territory. Any {E249 use} outside of the rights  {E63 granted}  herein shall  {E62 require}  an additional license from Diversinet. 2. Ownership and Representations  (a) Except as expressly  {E63 granted}  herein, Diversinet  does  not  {E64 grant}  any further rights, license or immunity to Reseller, and hereby retains and   does  not  {E65 waive}  any rights it may have with respect to patents, trade-marks, copyrights, moral rights or other intellectual property or  proprietary rights enforceable under the laws of any country.

Upon {E253 expiration} of the Initial  Term  , this Agreement shall automatically  {E80 renew}  for  consecutive one (1)  year  periods, unless  {E81 terminated}  by Reseller within sixty (60) days prior to the {E253 expiration} of the Initial  Term  or any renewal  term  ,  as the case may be (the Initial  Term  and each renewal  term  , collectively, the " Term  ").

(c) {E267 Termination} under Subsection 4(a) shall  {E105 trigger}  a phase-out period during which Reseller may  {E106 continue}  to  {E107 provide}  products and  {E268 services} to Customers. Such phase-out period shall be the longer of (i) the remaining  term  of the agreement between the Reseller and its  Customers, and (ii)  18 months . (d) Upon the {E274 termination} of this Agreement for any reason: (1) all rights  {E108 granted}  to Reseller hereunder shall automatically  {E109 come}  to an  end and revert to Diversinet,  {E110 including}  without limitation any right to  {E111 use}  ,  {E112 operate}  and  {E113 provide}  customer {E270 service} or {E271 support} for the Products;  (2) Reseller shall immediately  {E114 pay}  to Diversinet all amounts due and outstanding hereunder as of the  date  of such {E274 termination} or {E273 expiration};  and (3) within five (5) days of {E274 termination} of this Agreement, for whatever reason, Reseller, must: (a)  {E115 destroy}  all copies of the Products and  any associated Products documentation in its possession or under its direct control; and (b)  {E116 deliver}  to  {E117 Diversinet}  a  {E118 written}  certificate  warranting that it has  {E119 complied}  with the foregoing obligations. 1. Customer Orders  (a) Customer Agreements. The Parties  {E120 acknowledge}  and  {E121 agree}  that Reseller's Customers will  {E122 acquire}  the Products and  {E123 related}  {E275 services} under  contract with Reseller, that Diversinet shall not have any contractual interest in Reseller's Customer relationships. Prior to Reseller   {E124 committing}  to  {E125 provide}  any Products to a Customer, Reseller shall  {E126 cause}  Customer to  {E127 enter}  into purchase agreement(s) with Reseller with  respect to each of the Products  {E128 purchased}  by Customer (each, a "Customer Agreement"). Reseller  {E129 agrees}  that it shall  {E130 include}  terms and  conditions in its Customer Agreements that are sufficient to  {E131 protect}  Diversinet's interests as  {E132 reflected}  in this Agreement,  {E133 including}  , but not   {E134 limited}  to, those terms set out in Schedule 4 hereto.

Reseller shall  {E136 use}  commercially reasonable {E278 efforts} to  {E137 ensure}  that all Customers  {E138 abide}  by the terms of the  applicable Customer Agreement(s). Furthermore, Reseller shall  {E139 enforce}  its Customer Agreements against Customer when  {E140 requested}  to  do  so  by Diversinet. For greater clarity, Diversinet  {E141 expects}  that the Reseller will  {E142 include}  all of the points  {E143 covered}  in Section 4 in its end user  agreement. When the Reseller  {E144 receives}  a customer {E281 order} they will  {E145 fax}  both the end user agreement and the details of the {E281 order} to Diversinet  and if the end user agreement  {E146 contains}  all of the points  {E147 outlined}  in Section 4 then Diversinet will  {E148 approve}  the {E281 order} and {E240 ship} the  {E149 required}   products to the Reseller.

(b) Unless otherwise  {E161 agreed}  to by the Parties, {E292 delivery} of the Products shall  {E162 take}  place via electronic {E293 transmission} or by courier, and will  {E163 take}   place within two (2) Business Days of a  {E164 written}  request or purchase {E294 order} for software and within five (5) Business Days for a standard  appliance. Custom  {E165 built}  appliances or software are subject to {E296 evaluation} and delivery  date  will be  {E166 communicated}  after {E296 assessment}. "Business  Day" shall mean  9:00 a.m.  to  5:00 p.m.  (Eastern Standard Time),  Monday  through  Friday ,  {E167 excluding}  all statutory holidays  {E168 observed}  in the  Province of Ontario in Canada. {E297 Delivery} will be F.O.B.

Unless Reseller  {E172 notifies}  Diversinet within such fifteen (15)  day  period that  any of the Products  {E173 fail}  to substantially  {E174 comply}  with the relevant documentation, such Products shall be  {E175 deemed}   {E176 accepted}  . In the event  Reseller  {E300 rejects}  any of the Products, Reseller shall  {E178 give}  Diversinet  {E179 written}  notice of {E300 rejection},  {E180 specifying}  in reasonable detail the basis for  such {E300 rejection}. Diversinet will  {E181 use}  commercially reasonable {E302 efforts} to  {E182 correct}  any {E303 nonconformance} and {E241 re -   deliver}  such Products to Reseller. 1.
