You are  {E157 expected}  to  {E158 observe}  this rule very strictly since failure to  do  so will  {E159 entitle}  the Company to  {E160 stop}  payment in respect of  each day  you  {E161 fail}  to  {E162 notify}  the Company. 9.2 If your absence, due to sickness or injury, is for less than seven (7)  days  , on your return to work you are  {E163 required}  to immediately  {E164 complete}  a self-certification form available from the Company.

This doctor's certificate must be  {E167 provided}  to the Company promptly  following  the seventh consecutive  day  of absence. If illness  {E168 continues}  after the expiry of the first certificate, further certificates must be  {E169 provided}  promptly to  {E170 cover}  the whole period of absence. 9.3 Subject to your compliance with the Company's sickness absence procedures (as  {E171 amended}  from time to time), the Company may in its sole and absolute discretion  {E172 pay}  full salary and contractual benefits during any period of absence due to sickness or injury for up to an aggregate of  3 months  in any fifty-two (52) week period (whether such absence is continuous or intermittent in any calendar  year  ).

The Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion,  {E173 extend}  the period of allowance in an individual case if the circumstances so  {E174 justify}  . Thereafter, the Company shall  {E175 pay}  statutory sick pay or equivalent benefit to which you may be  {E176 entitled}  subject to your compliance with the appropriate rules. 9.4 Whether absent from work or not, you may be, but only on reasonable grounds,  {E177 required}  to  {E178 undergo}  a medical examination by a Company doctor and your consent will be  {E179 sought}  for a report to be  {E180 sent}  to the Company. 9.5 The payment of sick pay in accordance with this paragraph 9 is without prejudice to the Company's right to  {E181 terminate}  this Agreement prior to the expiry of your right to payments. 9.6 In the event you are incapable of  {E182 performing}  your duties by reason of injuries  {E183 sustained}  wholly or partly as a result of a third party's actions all payments  {E184 made}  to you by the Company as salary or sick pay shall to the extent that compensation is recoverable from that third party constitute loans to you and shall be due and owing when and to the extent that you  {E185 recover}  compensation for loss of earnings from the third party.
