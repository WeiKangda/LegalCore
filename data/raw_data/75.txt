If such test verifies the Negative {E253 Effect} of the back button(s) to the Women.com Site, eDiets may  {E57 remove}  any such back buttons. 1.3 Except as set forth in Section 1.2  [Women], eDiets will have sole responsibility for  {E58 providing}  and  {E59 maintaining}  at its own expense the Diet Center beneath the Gateway Page. eDiets and Women.com will  {E60 work}  together  {E61 regarding}  the on- going  {E254 design} and {E255 maintenance} of the Diet Center. 1.4 Each party shall  {E62 bear}  its own expenses  {E63 related}  to its responsibilities under this Section 1. 2.
