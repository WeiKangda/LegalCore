In the event this Agreement is  {E78 terminated}  for any reason,                   MICOA  {E91 agrees}  to  {E92 purchase}  from Agency, and Agency  {E93 agrees}  to                    {E94 sell}  to MICOA Agency's ownership interest in the expirations                   for the MICOA insurance  {E95 issued}  pursuant to this Agreement.
