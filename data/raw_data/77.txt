WHEREAS Diversinet is a provider of mobile device security and authentication solutions for the mobile data ecosystem, and is the owner of  certain software products, user documentation and {E242 services} and the related trade-marks;    AND WHEREAS Reseller has  {E9 represented}  that it is qualified and desires to  {E10 act}  as a reseller of certain of Diversinet's products within a certain   {E11 defined}  territory, and  {E12 agrees}  to  {E13 use}  its best {E333 efforts} to  {E14 market}  and  {E15 sell}  such products in such territory;    NOW THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual promises and commitments  {E16 contained}  hereafter and other considerations, the {E243 receipt}  and sufficiency of which is hereby  {E17 acknowledged}  , the Parties have  {E18 entered}  into this Agreement for the purpose of  {E19 permitting}  Reseller to  {E14 market}   and  {E15 sell}  certain of Diversinet's products pursuant to the terms and conditions set out as  follows  . 1. Appointment  Subject to {E244 payment} of the Annual Minimum Commitment ("AMC"  -  {E22 defined}  herein), Diversinet hereby grants to Reseller an exclusive, non- transferable and non-assignable right to market,  {E15 sell}  , and sub- {E24 license}  those Diversinet products  {E25 listed}  in Schedule 2 (the "Products") within the  territory  {E26 listed}  in Schedule 3 (the "Territory") to Canadian  {E27 headquartered}  companies, and governmental and broader public sector entities  {E28 located}   in Canada. Reseller's customers (the "Customers") are  {E29 defined}  as those organizations/enterprises that will  {E30 market}  and  {E31 manage}  the end-users of the  Products (the "End-Users"). Reseller  {E32 acknowledges}  and  {E33 agrees}  that it  does  not have the right to  {E34 assign}  sub-resellers under this Agreement  outside of the Territory, except with the prior  {E35 written}  consent of Diversinet. Furthermore, if Reseller  {E36 terminates}  the AMC in the manner  {E37 contemplated}  in Schedule 3, the exclusive license above shall  {E38 revert}  to being a non- exclusive license. In either case, Reseller will have the non-exclusive right to  {E39 contract}  in the rest of the world,  {E40 excluding}  the United States. If Reseller  {E41 identifies}  End- Users in the United States, with the prior  {E42 written}  consent of Diversinet, Reseller may  {E43 sell}  the Products to the End-Users. United Stated revenues  will not be  {E44 counted}  against the AMC however Reseller will be  {E45 entitled}  to the discount rates as  {E46 indicated}  in Schedule 3.. In addition, Diversinet hereby grants to Reseller the right to  {E247 use}  those Diversinet trademarks and  {E51 copyrighted}  materials with respect to the  Products solely for the purpose of {E14 marketing} and {E246 distribution} of the Products as  {E49 authorized}  hereunder. Reseller  {E50 acknowledges}  that the {E247 use} of such  trademarks and  {E51 copyrighted}  materials  does  not  {E52 create}  in its favour any right, whether of ownership or otherwise, to such trade-marks and   {E51 copyrighted}  materials, and that all rights  {E54 arising}  from the {E247 use}  {E55 thereof}  by Reseller shall  {E56 inure}  to the benefit of Diversinet. Reseller  {E57 agrees}  that the rights  {E58 granted}  to Reseller in this Section 1 are solely for the purpose of  {E59 supplying}  the Products to Reseller, its Customers  and End-Users  {E60 located}  in the Territory. Any {E249 use} outside of the rights  {E63 granted}  herein shall  {E62 require}  an additional license from Diversinet. 2. Ownership and Representations  (a) Except as expressly  {E63 granted}  herein, Diversinet  does  not  {E64 grant}  any further rights, license or immunity to Reseller, and hereby retains and   does  not  {E65 waive}  any rights it may have with respect to patents, trade-marks, copyrights, moral rights or other intellectual property or  proprietary rights enforceable under the laws of any country. Reseller shall not  {E66 authorize}  anyone to  {E67 reverse}  engineer, decompile, alter,  transfer,  {E68 modify}  or  {E69 create}  a derivative work from any of the Products, nor may Reseller itself  {E70 engage}  in so  {E71 doing}  .

Upon {E253 expiration} of the Initial  Term  , this Agreement shall automatically  {E80 renew}  for  consecutive one (1)  year  periods, unless  {E81 terminated}  by Reseller within sixty (60) days prior to the {E253 expiration} of the Initial  Term  or any renewal  term  ,  as the case may be (the Initial  Term  and each renewal  term  , collectively, the " Term  "). Any  annual  {E255 renewal} would be subject to the {E256 payment}, if  applicable, of the AMC as  {E82 agreed}  to by the parties, however such AMC will not be less than  the previous year  AMC times 115%, payable in  applicable  quarterly  instalments. 4. Termination  (a) Either Party may  {E83 terminate}  this Agreement:  (i) Upon thirty (30) days'  written  notice to Reseller if Reseller  {E84 fails}  to  {E85 make}  any AMC {E257 payment} when due under this Agreement, or when  an {E258 audit}, as set out in Section 13, by Diversinet  {E86 reveals}  any {E259 under-payment} for any {E260 payment} due, and it is not  {E87 paid}  within the thirty (30)   day   {E88 written}  notice period;   (ii)  {E89 providing}  thirty (60) days'  {E90 written}  notice to the other Party if the other Party  {E91 breaches}  any material  term  or condition of this Agreement,  and  {E92 fails}  to  {E93 cure}  such {E91 breach} within  the 60  ;  (iii) upon  day  period {E94 providing}  thirty (30) days'  {E95 written}  notice to Reseller if Reseller  {E96 terminates}  the provisions of the Annual Minimum Commitment  and  {E97 fails}  to  {E98 meet}  the sales targets as set out in Schedule 3.

(c) {E267 Termination} under Subsection 4(a) shall  {E105 trigger}  a phase-out period during which Reseller may  {E106 continue}  to  {E107 provide}  products and  {E268 services} to Customers. Such phase-out period shall be the longer of (i) the remaining  term  of the agreement between the Reseller and its  Customers, and (ii)  18 months . (d) Upon the {E274 termination} of this Agreement for any reason: (1) all rights  {E108 granted}  to Reseller hereunder shall automatically  {E109 come}  to an  end and revert to Diversinet,  {E110 including}  without limitation any right to  {E111 use}  ,  {E112 operate}  and  {E113 provide}  customer {E270 service} or {E271 support} for the Products;  (2) Reseller shall immediately  {E114 pay}  to Diversinet all amounts due and outstanding hereunder as of the  date  of such {E274 termination} or {E273 expiration};  and (3) within five (5) days of {E274 termination} of this Agreement, for whatever reason, Reseller, must: (a)  {E115 destroy}  all copies of the Products and  any associated Products documentation in its possession or under its direct control; and (b)  {E116 deliver}  to  {E117 Diversinet}  a  {E118 written}  certificate  warranting that it has  {E119 complied}  with the foregoing obligations. 1. Customer Orders  (a) Customer Agreements. The Parties  {E120 acknowledge}  and  {E121 agree}  that Reseller's Customers will  {E122 acquire}  the Products and  {E123 related}  {E268 services} under  contract with Reseller, that Diversinet shall not have any contractual interest in Reseller's Customer relationships. Prior to Reseller   {E124 committing}  to  {E125 provide}  any Products to a Customer, Reseller shall  {E126 cause}  Customer to  {E127 enter}  into purchase agreement(s) with Reseller with  respect to each of the Products  {E128 purchased}  by Customer (each, a "Customer Agreement"). Reseller  {E129 agrees}  that it shall  {E130 include}  terms and  conditions in its Customer Agreements that are sufficient to  {E131 protect}  Diversinet's interests as  {E132 reflected}  in this Agreement,  {E133 including}  , but not   {E134 limited}  to, those terms set out in Schedule 4 hereto. Such Customer Agreements shall be subject to Diversinet's {E277 approval}, which {E277 approval}  shall not be unreasonably  {E135 withheld}  . Reseller shall  {E136 use}  commercially reasonable {E278 efforts} to  {E137 ensure}  that all Customers  {E138 abide}  by the terms of the  applicable Customer Agreement(s). Furthermore, Reseller shall  {E139 enforce}  its Customer Agreements against Customer when  {E140 requested}  to  do  so  by Diversinet. For greater clarity, Diversinet  {E141 expects}  that the Reseller will  {E142 include}  all of the points  {E143 covered}  in Section 4 in its end user  agreement. When the Reseller  {E144 receives}  a customer {E281 order} they will  {E145 fax}  both the end user agreement and the details of the {E281 order} to Diversinet  and if the end user agreement  {E146 contains}  all of the points  {E147 outlined}  in Section 4 then Diversinet will  {E148 approve}  the {E281 order} and {E240 ship} the  {E149 required}   products to the Reseller. (b) Ordering Process. Reseller shall  {E283 submit}  all {E281 orders} to Diversinet for the applicable Products. Reseller's {E283 submission} of {E281 orders} to Diversinet  shall  {E151 comply}  at all times with Diversinet's reasonable procedures and requirements and are subject to {E285 acceptance} by Diversinet acting  reasonably. Reseller shall be solely responsible for all {E286 sales activity}  {E152 culminating}  in and  {E153 including}  the {E287 procurement} of fully- {E154 executed}  Customer  Agreements and purchase {E156 orders}  {E155 specifying}  the Products and {E268 Services}  {E156 ordered}  and the specific number of tokens. 1. Delivery  (a) Subject to Reseller's {E290 compliance} with the terms and procedures set forth in this Agreement, Diversinet shall  {E157 provide}  to Reseller or to  Customers the Products properly  {E158 ordered}  by Reseller and  {E159 accepted}  by Diversinet in material {E291 compliance} with the applicable terms hereof,  notwithstanding any inconsistent or additional terms which Reseller  {E160 includes}  in any Customer agreement. (b) Unless otherwise  {E161 agreed}  to by the Parties, {E292 delivery} of the Products shall  {E162 take}  place via electronic {E293 transmission} or by courier, and will  {E163 take}   place within two (2) Business Days of a  {E164 written}  request or purchase {E294 order} for software and within five (5) Business Days for a standard  appliance. Custom  {E165 built}  appliances or software are subject to {E296 evaluation} and delivery  date  will be  {E166 communicated}  after {E296 assessment}. "Business  Day" shall mean  9:00 a.m.  to  5:00 p.m.  (Eastern Standard Time),  Monday  through  Friday ,  {E167 excluding}  all statutory holidays  {E168 observed}  in the  Province of Ontario in Canada. {E297 Delivery} will be F.O.B.

Unless Reseller  {E172 notifies}  Diversinet within such fifteen (15)  day  period that  any of the Products  {E173 fail}  to substantially  {E174 comply}  with the relevant documentation, such Products shall be  {E175 deemed}   {E176 accepted}  . In the event  Reseller  {E300 rejects}  any of the Products, Reseller shall  {E178 give}  Diversinet  {E179 written}  notice of {E300 rejection},  {E180 specifying}  in reasonable detail the basis for  such {E300 rejection}. Diversinet will  {E181 use}  commercially reasonable {E302 efforts} to  {E182 correct}  any {E303 nonconformance} and {E241 re -   deliver}  such Products to Reseller. 1.
