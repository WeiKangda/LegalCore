business  day  . Supplier will  {E31 confirm}  or  {E32 reject}  Purchase Orders within [***] of receipt of the Purchase Order. Orders not  {E33 rejected}  in writing within such time will be  {E34 deemed}   {E31 confirmed}  and  {E36 accepted}  by Supplier. Each Purchase Order  {E37 issued}  by PNC or its TPMs and  {E36 accepted}  by Supplier shall be  {E39 governed}  by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Additional terms  {E40 included}  in acknowledgments, standard terms and conditions, or any other documents or communications  {E41 exchanged}  by the Parties in connection with the sale or purchase of any Ingredients shall be void and of no force or effect. The Parties may only  {E42 modify}  ,  {E43 add}  to or  {E44 amend}  any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement by a writing  {E45 signed}  by authorized representatives of both Parties. 1.5 Supplier  {E46 represents}  and warrants that at the time and date of delivery, the Ingredients will  {E47 comply}  with all specifications ("Specifications"), a copy of which will be  {E48 attached}  to the relevant Master Purchase Commitment or Purchase Order accordingly.

The Supplier further  {E98 guarantees}  that as of the time and date of delivery, all of the Ingredients will be in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, requirements and programs  {E99 including}  those  {E100 administered}  by the Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA"), the United States Department of Agriculture (the "USDA") and any state or local food or drug laws then in effect. This guarantee specifically  {E101 includes}  Proposition 65 (California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act), and Supplier hereby certifies that the Ingredients will not  {E102 contain}  any non-naturally  occurring  chemicals subject to Proposition 65 or that any such chemicals  {E103 pose}  "no significant risk" or  {E104 cause}  "no observable effect" as set forth in the California Health and Safety Code, 22 CCR Â§Â§ 12701 et seq. and 22 CCR Â§Â§ 12801 et seq., as  {E105 amended}  . Supplier shall  {E106 comply}  with all applicable regulatory requirements for  determining  and  documenting  that all Ingredients are at or below no significant risk levels and no observable effect levels, as applicable. 2.2 Supplier shall  {E107 develop}  and  {E108 maintain}  a food safety/food defense program as  {E109 required}  under the Food Safety Modernization Act 21 USC Â§301 et seq and shall  {E110 submit}  a copy of such plan (and any changes thereto) to PNC upon PNC's request.

Supplier will  {E113 submit}  summaries of audit reports to PNC's Quality Manager at [***] upon request. Failure to  {E114 comply}  with the requirements of this Section 2.2 will  {E115 constitute}  a material breach of this Agreement. 2.3 Supplier will  {E116 notify}  PNC immediately, by person-to-person voice communication or equivalent means, if any of the Ingredients contain, or are reasonably suspected to contain, material hazardous to human health, including but not limited to, chemical, physical or biological hazards. 2.4 PNC shall  {E117 notify}  Supplier in  writing  if it  {E118 determines}  any Ingredient  {E119 fails}  to  {E120 meet}  the Specifications. Supplier shall be  {E121 given}  an opportunity to and will promptly  {E122 inspect}  and/or  {E123 test}  such Ingredients to  {E124 confirm}  compliance to Specification. If after any reasonable, good faith inspection and testing it is  {E125 confirmed}  that certain Ingredients  {E119 fail}  to  {E120 meet}  the Specifications [***]. 2.5 Subject to the occurring of a Force Majeure Event, if Supplier  {E128 fails}  to  {E129 deliver}  the Ingredients in accordance with the Specifications,  including  within the time  {E130 specified}  on the Purchase Order, in addition to any other remedies available, PNC may  {E131 terminate}  the Purchase Order in whole or in part. In the event of such a termination, Supplier shall  {E132 continue}  performance of any nonterminated portion of the Purchase Order, or any nonterminated Purchase Orders, and the quantity of Ingredient  {E133 ordered}  and so  {E131 terminated}  shall be  {E135 deducted}  against any relevant Master Purchase Commitment. 2.6 PNC or its  {E136 contracted}  third-party auditors may  {E137 enter}  and  {E138 audit}  / {E139 inspect}  Supplier's facilities where the Ingredients are  {E140 produced}  , stored,  {E141 packaged}  or otherwise  {E142 processed}  [***] unless food safety is at issue or PNC has a good faith reason to  {E143 believe}  the Ingredients are being  {E144 stored}  ,  {E141 packaged}  , or  {E142 processed}

For routine visits and audits, PNC will  {E148 provide}  [***] if facilities  {E149 located}  in the US and with [***] if facilities are  {E150 located}  [***],  {E151 provided}  that such examination will be  {E152 conducted}  during Supplier's normal business hours and in such a manner as to reasonably  {E2 minimize}  disruption to Supplier's business, unless food safety is at issue, in which case such examination may be  {E153 conducted}  at any time. Supplier shall  {E154 cooperate}  in good faith with PNC during all such inspections. During qualification processes and on-site inspections, Supplier will  {E155 present}  necessary documentation to  {E156 ensure}  compliance with all applicable programs  {E157 specified}  under 21 CFR Part 117  Current  Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk- {E158 Based}  Preventative Controls for Human Food. Records of environmental monitoring activities by the Supplier,  following  Supplier's  {E159 established}  environmental monitoring program and standard operating procedures will be  {E160 made}  available upon request to PNC. Supplier will  {E161 notify}  Buyer immediately via person-to- person voice communication in the event that any pathogen is  {E162 found}  , or reasonably  {E163 suspected}  , in the plant environment during any environmental monitoring activity that could have an impact on the quality or safety of PNC's Ingredients. In the event of an actual or  {E164 suspected}  food safety concern, Supplier shall  {E165 conduct}  sampling in all relevant areas and promptly  {E166 provide}  results of such tests to PNC. If PNC or its representatives  {E167 find}  that any of Supplier's facilities, processes, inventory, procedures or equipment are not in accordance or compliance with the requirements of this Agreement or applicable law or regulation, PNC will  {E168 give}  notice to Supplier, and Supplier shall promptly  {E169 take}  all reasonable steps to  {E170 correct}  such deficiency  as soon as possible . If correction of the deficiency cannot be  {E171 affected}  within [***] of such notice, then Supplier shall promptly  {E172 notify}  PNC with its plan to  {E173 correct}  the deficiency  including  an  {E174 estimated}  schedule. If the deficiency cannot be  {E175 corrected}  within [***], unless otherwise  {E176 agreed}  , then PNC shall have the right to  {E177 terminate}  any Purchase Orders then outstanding, along with any Master Purchase Commitment related thereto. 3 Business Continuity/Continuous Supply Assurances. Supplier will  {E178 develop}  and  {E179 maintain}  a business continuity plan that  {E180 identifies}  critical pathways and potential crisis situations that could  {E181 interrupt}  the supply of Ingredients to  {E182 PNC}  and  {E183 establish}  contingency plans for  dealing  with each crisis situation. Upon PNC's  {E184 written}  request, Supplier will  {E185 submit}  the business continuity plan to PNC for PNC's review. 4 Intellectual Property. 4.1 Each Party shall  {E186 retain}  ownership of all Intellectual Property Rights (as  {E187 defined}  below): (1)  {E188 owned}  or  {E189 licensed}  by that Party prior to the commencement date of this Agreement; or (2)  {E190 developed}  or  {E191 acquired}  independently of this Agreement by that Party or its licensors other than in connection with this Agreement. 4.2 Ownership in the Intellectual Property Rights, if any, of any developments and/or modifications to the Ingredients during the  Term  shall be [***]. 4.3 For purposes of this Section 4, the  term  "Intellectual Property Rights" shall mean all statutory, common law and proprietary intellectual property rights, including rights in know-how, confidential information, copyright works, designs, inventions, patents, plant varieties, trademarks and all other rights, whether registered or unregistered (including applications for such rights). 5 Confidential Information.
