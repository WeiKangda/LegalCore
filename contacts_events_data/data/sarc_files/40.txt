                     TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF AGREEMENT

1. LOCATION. During the  Term  (as  {E30 defined}  in Section 6 (a) below), NAI shall       {E31 provide}  the  following  marketing considerations to Co-Host:

  (a)  Co-Hosting Rights. Co-Host shall be  {E32 permitted}  to  {E33 maintain}  on the           Online Service Page (as  {E34 defined}  in Part 2 of Exhibit "A") of the           Originating Locations in the manner set forth on Exhibit "B" hereto           (and on such other positions as are set forth on Exhibit "B" or as the           parties may mutually  {E35 agree}  upon in writing from time to time) a hot           link to Internet locations  {E36 specified}  by the Co-Host (the           "Destination") from which Goods (other than Competitor's Goods           (hereinafter  defined  )) may be  {E37 sold}  . The web pages at the Destination           shall be  {E38 maintained}  in accordance with the requirements of this           Agreement,  including  without limitation, Section 2 hereof. "Competitor's Goods" as  {E39 used}  herein shall mean the Goods of any of the           persons or entities described on Part 1 of Exhibit "C" attached hereto           and made a part hereof. The Destination shall not  {E40 contain}  any links to           any third party sites for the purchase of Competitor's Goods;  {E41 provided}            that the Destination will  {E42 link}  to the Co-Host Site (which will  {E43 sell}            Competitor's Goods). (b)  Exclusive Positioning. Co-Host shall be the exclusive reseller of           software products ("Software") at the Originating Locations. The            preceding  sentence shall not  {E44 prohibit}  NAI from (i)  {E45 reselling}  Software            {E46 including}  NAI Goods (hereinafter  {E47 defined}  ) from the McAfee Mall; (ii)            {E48 referencing}  and  {E49 linking}  to sites of strategic partners (other than           competitors of Co-Host  {E50 listed}  on Part 2 of Exhibit "C") which may also           be  {E51 involved}  in the resale of Software from such sites;  {E52 provided}  that           no Software may be  {E53 purchased}  on the page of such site which is  {E54 linked}            to any Originating Location and further  {E55 provided}  that the references           and  {E56 links}  to the sites of strategic partners shall not be  {E57 placed}  on           the Online Service Page; and (iii)  advertising  Software with banners,           buttons and other forms of online advertising;  {E58 provided}  that any link           from such advertising  {E59 takes}  the end user to the publisher of the           Software and not a reseller of Goods (other than Co-Host). For           example, an advertising banner or button for the Windows 98 software           program may  {E60 link}  back to the website of Microsoft Corporation but not           the website of Dell Computer Corporation which is  {E61 reselling}  the           program. Without limitation on the foregoing, NAI may  {E189 co   -   host}  a           comparative shopping service on the Originating Locations. NAI will            {E62 obtain}  a  {E63 written}  covenant that the comparative shopping co-host will           present sellers of Software in a neutral manner and upon request of           Co-Host will  {E64 require}  removal or alteration of presentations by such           co-host on such co-hosted facility which Co-Host reasonably  {E65 deems}  to           be non-neutral;  {E66 provided}  , however, that, notwithstanding the           foregoing, Co-Host may be the  {E67 featured}  or most prominent Software           reseller on any such service. (c)  Short  Term  Product Exclusives. For a period of fourteen (14)  days             {E68 following}  release of any new NAI Goods or major version releases           (i.e., version 3.0 to 4.0) of  {E69 existing}  NAI Goods, Co-Host shall be the           exclusive online seller of any such

                                    3    4

       release  {E70 released}  during the  Term  . "NAI Goods" as  {E71 used}  herein shall           mean retail desktop software products offered by NAI under the           "McAfee" brand or other NAI owned brand, which NAI makes available for           resale through distributors and resellers via the Internet. (d)  Reference Site. Co-Host may  {E72 refer}  to the Originating Locations as a           Co-Host customer location and to NAI as a Co-Host customer hereunder            {E73 provided}  all such references shall be subject to the prior review and           approval of NAI, which approval will not be unreasonably  {E74 withheld}  . (e)  Links to Online Service Page. Any end user  {E75 accessing}  the principal           URLs of NAI (e.g., mcafee.com, cybermedia.com, pgp.com, tis.com) shall           be  {E76 taken}  to the Online Service Page. Any end user  {E77 accessing}  a "buy"           button on any of the Originating Locations shall be  {E78 taken}  to the           Online Service Page. NAI shall not  {E79 sell}  retail desktop consumer           products,  {E80 including}  without limitation, NAI Goods from the NAI           Internet Sites (other than the McAfee Mall). NAI  {E81 reserves}  the right to  {E82 change}  the URL of the Originating Locations           from time to time and  {E83 agrees}  to  {E84 give}  Co-Host as much notice of any           such change as is practicable. 2. MARKETING AND SALES. (a)  Placement of Order. In consideration of the Co-Hosting Fee set forth           in Part 3 of Exhibit "A", NAI shall  {E85 provide}  the marketing           consideration  {E86 identified}  in Section 1 during the  Term  of this





       Agreement. (b)  Advertising Materials; Destination Operation. Co-Host shall  {E87 provide}  to           NAI artwork and text materials with respect to the advertisement of           the Destination at the Originating Locations. Such artwork and           materials must be non-infringing, inoffensive, accurate, truthful and           otherwise  {E88 comply}  with all applicable laws. Co-Host shall  {E89 comply}  with           all applicable laws in connection with the operation of the           Destination,  {E90 including}  without limitation, requirements  {E91 regarding}  the           confidentiality of information  {E92 concerning}  end users. NAI  {E93 retains}  the           right, but not the obligation, to  {E94 disapprove}  or  {E95 remove}  any           advertisements or advertising materials it reasonably  {E96 deems}  illegal,           inappropriate or otherwise inconsistent with the purposes of the           Originating Sites, without the consent of Co-Host. (c)  Use of Trademarks. Co-Host hereby grants to NAI a non-exclusive,           non-transferable, royalty-free license during the  term  of this           Agreement to  {E97 use}  the trademarks, service marks and trade names of           Co-Host in connection with the advertising and promotion of the Goods           from the Originating Locations,  {E98 provided}  that NAI complies with the           terms of Section 9(b) of the Web Site Services Agreement (as  {E99 defined}            below). Co-Host reserves the right to  {E100 terminate}  the  foregoing  right,           after  {E101 giving}  NAI notice and opportunity to  {E102 cure}  the allegedly harmful           use, if in Co-Host's reasonable judgment, NAI's use of such           trademarks, service marks and trade names  {E103 harms}  the business, image or           goodwill of Co-Host. 4    5

  (d)  Limited Duty of Promotion. NAI shall have no duty or obligation to           advertise or  {E104 promote}  the Goods, other than as set forth in this           Section 2. Except as expressly set forth herein ( {E105 including}  , without           limitation, as set forth in this Section 2(d)), NAI  does  not,           expressly or impliedly, guaranty or  {E106 warrant}  any results or level of           sales or customer leads to Co-Host. NAI  {E107 reserves}  the right to  {E108 cease}            publication of the Originating Locations for brief periods from time           to time for maintenance or other purposes;  {E109 provided}  that the           Originating Locations will  {E110 comply}  with the same "Uptime Requirements"            {E111 specified}  with respect to the " {E112 Managed}  Site" in the Web Site Services           Agreement. (e)  Marketing Promotions. During the  Term  , Co-Host and NAI will regularly            {E113 discuss}  and  {E114 implement}  mutually  {E115 agreed}  upon jointly  {E116 funded}  marketing           promotions. NAI and Co-Host hereby  {E117 agree}  that the marketing promotions           set forth on Exhibit "D" hereto will be  {E118 implemented}  as set forth on           Exhibit "D". (f)  Distribution of Physical Products.
