CNET will  {E52 determine}  the location and           type of each Retail Promotion  {E53 displayed}  throughout the CNET Sites and           may  {E54 phase}  in certain types of Retail Promotions as they are  {E55 developed}  . CNET  currently   {E56 intends}  to  {E60 display}  Retail Promotions  {E58 consisting}  of           text/HTML links,  {E224 pre   -   filled}  with an appropriate query string or link           ("Pre- Filled  Links"), as set forth in this Section.

For the           purposes of clarity, the "fold" is  {E65 defined}  as the visible portion of           the screen on a standard 640 x 480 screen size. 2.4.1  On SEARCH.COM, CNET  {E66 intends}  to  {E67 display}  a {E225 Pre- Filled}  Link on the

The Company will  {E77 design}            any graphics  {E78 required}  for the Online Promotions and  {E79 provide}  pre-filled           query strings or links for all of the {E229 Pre- Filled}  Links, with           reasonable {E247 assistance} from CNET, and the Company will  {E80 supply}  digital           copies of such graphics and other materials to CNET. CNET will be           responsible for  {E81 incorporating}  the Online Promotions into the CNET           Sites and for  {E82 ensuring}  that the Online Promotions are accessible to           users of the CNET Sites ("Users"). 2.6  Reporting.

CNET will also  {E87 provide}  standard  {E88 reporting}  for banner           advertisements and television Promotions. 3. The Company's Obligations:

     3.1  Operation of Company Site. The Company will be responsible for            {E89 ensuring}  that each link  {E90 embedded}  within an Online Promotion  {E91 takes}  the           User to the appropriate area within the Company Site, and that the           Company Site  {E92 functions}  with reasonable reliability and in a           commercially reasonable manner throughout the  Term  . In particular, the           Company  {E93 agrees}  that the Company Site will  {E94 comply}  with the performance           standards set forth in Exhibit B throughout the  Term  . Any {E248 failure} by           the Company to  {E95 comply}  with this paragraph will be  {E96 deemed}  to be a           material {E249 breach} of this Agreement. 3.2  Reporting.

The           "CNET Sales" will be  {E101 counted}  as {E254 sales} by the Company to each User who            {E102 accesses}  the Company Site through a link from an Online Promotion for           a period of  4 hours  from the {E255 referral}, CNET and The Company will  {E103 agree}            on technical procedures to  {E104 allow}  the easy and accurate {E259 reporting} of           CNET Sales. The Company will  {E105 make}  this information available in a           manner which

             {E106 allows}  CNET and the Company to  {E107 understand}  the {E257 performance} of the           various Online Promotions. 3.3  Cash Consideration. 3.3.1  For  each month  during the  Term  , the Company will  {E261 pay}  CNET a                  minimum of [XXXX] in cash, plus [XXX] of CNET Sales. {E273 Payments}                  under this paragraph will be  {E109 based}  on the {E259 reports}  {E110 prepared}  by                  the Company under Section 3.2 (although CNET may  {E111 challenge}  such                  {E259 reports} as  {E112 contemplated}  by Section 9.5) and will be due within                   30 days  after the end of  each month  of the  Term  . 3.3.2  {E261 Payments} under this Section 3.3 will be  {E113 made}  by wire transfer                  of immediately available funds and are nonrefundable once  {E261 paid}  . 3.4  User Information.
