Ladies and Gentlemen:

Athens Bancshares Corporation, a Tennessee corporation (the "Company"), and Athens Federal Community Bank, a federal savings bank  {E2 located}   in Athens, Tennessee (the "Bank") (references to the "Bank"  {E3 include}  the Bank in mutual or stock form as  {E4 indicated}  by the context), the deposit  accounts of which are  {E5 insured}  by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), hereby  {E6 confirm}  their agreement with Keefe, Bruyette &  Woods, Inc. (the "Agent") as  follows  :

Section 1. The Offering. The Bank, in accordance with its plan of conversion  {E7 adopted}  by its Board of Directors (the "Plan"),  {E8 intends}  to  {E9 convert}   from a federally- {E10 chartered}  mutual savings bank to a federal stock savings bank (the "Conversion"), and  {E11 issue}  all of its issued and outstanding  capital stock to the Company. The Conversion will be  {E12 accomplished}  pursuant to federal law and the rules and regulations of the Office of Thrift  Supervision (the "OTS"). Pursuant to the Plan, the Company will  {E13 offer}  and  {E14 sell}  up to shares (subject to  {E15 increase}  up to shares) of its common stock,  $.01 par value per share (the "Shares" or "Common Shares"), in a subscription offering (the "Subscription Offering") to (1) depositors of the Bank  with Qualifying Deposits (as  {E16 defined}  in the Plan) as of  March 31, 2008  ("Eligible Account Holders"), (2) the employee stock ownership plan   {E17 established}  by either the Bank or the Company (the "ESOP"), (3) depositors of the Bank with Qualifying Deposits as of  September 30, 2009   ("Supplemental Eligible Account Holders"), and (4) other depositor and borrower members of the Bank as  {E18 defined}  in the Plan. Subject to the prior  subscription rights of the above- {E19 listed}  parties, the Company may  {E20 offer}  for sale in a community offering (the "Community Offering" and when   {E21 referred}  to together with or subsequent to the Subscription Offering, the "Subscription and Community Offering") the Shares not  {E22 subscribed}  for or   {E23 ordered}  in the Subscription  Offering  to members of the general public to whom a copy of the Prospectus (as hereinafter  defined  ) is  {E24 delivered}  with a  preference  {E25 given}  first to natural persons who are residents of Blount, Bradley, Hamilton, Knox, Loudon, McMinn, Meras, Monroe and Polk  Counties in Tennessee. It is  {E26 anticipated}  that shares not  {E27 subscribed}  for in the Subscription and Community Offering may be  {E28 offered}  to certain  members of the general public on a best efforts basis through a  {E29 selected}  dealers agreement (the "Syndicated Community Offering") (the  Subscription Offering, Community Offering and Syndicated Community Offering are collectively  {E30 referred}  to as the "Offering"). It is  {E31 acknowledged}   that the purchase of Shares in the Offering is subject to the maximum and minimum purchase limitations as  {E32 described}  in the Plan and that the  Company may  {E33 reject}  , in whole or in part, any orders  {E34 received}  in the Community Offering or Syndicated Community Offering. In connection with the Conversion and pursuant to the terms of the Plan as  {E35 described}  in the Prospectus, immediately  following  the consummation  of the Conversion, subject to the approval of the Bank's depositors and compliance with certain conditions as may be  {E36 imposed}  by regulatory  authorities, the Company will  {E37 contribute}  $100,000 and 100,000 shares of Common Stock to the Athens Federal Foundation (the "Foundation") such  shares hereinafter being  {E38 referred}  to as the ("Foundation Shares"). The Company has  {E39 filed}  with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-   )  (the "Registration Statement"),  containing  a prospectus  relating  to the Offering, for the registration of the Shares under the Securities Act of  1933   (the " 1933  Act"), and has  {E40 filed}  such amendments thereof and such  {E41 amended}  prospectuses as may have been  {E42 required}  to the date hereof. The  term   "Registration Statement" shall  {E43 include}  any documents  {E44 incorporated}  by reference therein and all financial schedules and exhibits thereto, as   {E45 amended}  ,  including  post-effective amendments. The prospectus, as  {E46 amended}  , on file with the Commission at the time the Registration Statement  initially  {E47 became}  effective is hereinafter  {E48 called}  the "Prospectus," except that if any Prospectus is  {E49 filed}  by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c)  of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the  1933  Act (the " 1933  Act Regulations")  differing  from the prospectus on file at the time  the Registration Statement initially  {E50 became}  effective, the  term  "Prospectus" shall  {E51 refer}  to the prospectus  {E52 filed}  pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) from  and after the time  {E53 said}  prospectus is  {E54 filed}  with the Commission. In accordance with Title 12, Part 563b of the Code of Federal Regulations (the "Conversion Regulations"), the Bank has  {E55 filed}  with the OTS an  Application For Conversion on Form AC (the "Form AC"),  including  the Prospectus and the Conversion Valuation Appraisal Report  {E56 prepared}  by  Keller & Company, Inc. (the "Appraisal") and has  {E57 filed}  such amendments  {E58 thereto}  as may have been  {E59 required}  by the OTS. The Form AC has been   {E60 approved}  by the OTS and the related Prospectus has been  {E61 authorized}  for use by the OTS. In addition, the Company has  {E62 filed}  with the OTS its  Application H-(e)l-S (the "Holding Company Application") to  {E63 become}  a savings and loan  holding  company under the Home Owners' Loan Act, as   {E64 amended}  ("HOLA") and the regulations  {E65 promulgated}  thereunder (the "Control Act Regulations"). Section 2. Retention and Compensation of Agent. Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company and the Bank hereby  {E66 appoint}   the Agent as their exclusive financial advisor and marketing agent (i) to  {E67 utilize}  its best efforts to  {E68 solicit}  subscriptions for Common Shares and to   {E69 advise}  and  {E70 assist}  the Company and the Bank with respect to the Company's sale of the Shares in the Offering and (ii) to  {E71 participate}  in the Offering  in the areas of market making and in syndicate formation (if necessary). On the basis of the representations, warranties, and agreements herein  {E72 contained}  , but subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the  Agent  {E73 accepts}  such appointment and  {E74 agrees}  to  {E75 consult}  with and  {E76 advise}  the Company and the Bank as to the matters set forth in the letter  agreement,  dated   June 9, 2009 , between the Bank and the Agent (a copy of which is  {E77 attached}  hereto as Exhibit A) (the "Engagement Letter"). It is   {E78 acknowledged}  by the Company and the Bank that the Agent shall not be  {E79 required}  to  {E80 purchase}  any Shares or be  {E81 obligated}  to  {E82 take}  any action which  is inconsistent with all applicable laws, regulations, decisions or orders. The obligations of the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall  {E83 terminate}  upon termination of the Offering, but in no event later than  45 days  after  the completion of the Subscription Offering (the "End  Date  "). All fees or expenses due to the Agent but unpaid will be payable to the Agent in   next day  funds at the earlier of the Closing  Date  (as hereinafter  {E84 defined}  ) or the End  Date  . In the event the Offering is  {E85 extended}  beyond the End   Date  , the Company and the Agent may  {E86 agree}  to  {E87 renew}  this Agreement under mutually acceptable terms. In the event the Company is unable to  {E88 sell}  a minimum of    Shares within the period herein  {E89 provided}  , this Agreement shall  {E90 terminate}  and the  Company shall  {E91 refund}  to any persons who have  {E92 subscribed}  for any of the Shares the full amount which it may have  {E93 received}  from them plus   {E94 accrued}  interest, as set forth in the Prospectus; and none of the parties to this Agreement shall have any obligation to the other parties hereunder,  except as set forth in this Section 2 and in Sections 7, 9 and 10 hereof. In the event the Offering is  {E95 terminated}  for any reason not attributable to the  action or inaction of the Agent, the Agent shall be  {E96 paid}  the fees due to the date of such termination pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (d) below. 2

The Agent shall  {E97 receive}  the  following  compensation for its services hereunder:

(a) A management fee of $30,000 payable in four consecutive  monthly  installments of $7,500 each commencing with the execution of the  Engagement Letter. This fee shall be  {E98 deemed}  to have been  {E99 earned}  when due and shall be non-refundable. (b) A success fee upon completion of the Offering of 1.125% of the aggregate purchase price of the Common Shares  {E14 sold}  in the Subscription  Offering and Community  {E101 Offering}   {E102 excluding}  shares  {E103 purchased}  by the Bank's officers, directors, or employees (or members of their immediate  family), any ESOP, tax-qualified or stock- {E104 based}  compensation plans (except IRAs) or similar plan  {E105 created}  by the Bank or the Company for some or  all of its directors or employees, or  {E106 contributed}  to any charitable foundation  {E107 established}  by the Bank in connection with the Conversion. In no  event shall the success fee  {E108 paid}  for the sale of Common Stock in the Subscription and Community Offering be less than $200,000. The management  fee will be  {E109 applied}  against the first success fee. (c) If any of the Common Shares  {E110 remain}  available after the Subscription Offering, at the request of the Company, the Agent will  {E111 seek}  to  {E112 form}  a  syndicate of  {E113 registered}  broker-dealers ("Selected Dealers") to  {E114 assist}  in the sale of such Common Shares on a best efforts basis, subject to the  terms and conditions set forth in the  {E115 selected}  dealers agreement. The Agent will  {E116 endeavor}  to  {E117 distribute}  the Common Shares among the Selected  Dealers in a fashion which best  {E118 meets}  the distribution objectives of the Bank and the Plan. The Agent will be  {E119 paid}  a fee not to  {E120 exceed}  5.5% of the  aggregate Purchase Price of the Shares  {E121 sold}  in the Syndicated Community Offering. The Agent will  {E122 pass}  onto the Selected Dealers who  {E123 assist}  in  the Syndicated Community  Offering  an amount competitive with gross underwriting discounts  {E124 charged}  at such time for comparable amounts of  stock  {E125 sold}  at a comparable price per share in a similar market environment. Fees with respect to purchases  {E126 effected}  with the assistance of Selected  Dealers other than the Agent shall be  {E127 transmitted}  by the Agent to such Selected Dealers. The decision to  {E128 utilize}  Selected Dealers will be  {E129 made}  by  the Company upon consultation with the Agent. (d) The Company and the Bank shall  {E130 reimburse}  the Agent for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses,  including  costs of travel, meals and lodging,  photocopying, telephone, facsimile and couriers. The Company and the Bank will  {E130 reimburse}  the Agent for the fees and expenses of the Agent's  counsel which will not  {E132 exceed}  $50,000. The Company will  {E133 bear}  the expenses of the Offering customarily  {E134 borne}  by issuers  including  , without  limitation, regulatory filing fees, SEC, "Blue Sky," and FINRA filing and registration fees; the fees of the Company's accountants, attorneys,  appraiser, transfer agent and registrar, printing, mailing and marketing and syndicate expenses  {E135 associated}  with the conversion; and the fees set  forth under this Section 2; and any fees for Blue Sky legal work. Full payment of the Agent's actual and accountable expenses, advisory fees and compensation shall be  {E136 made}  in  next day  funds on the earlier of  the Closing  Date  or a determination by the Bank to  {E137 terminate}  or  {E138 abandon}  the Offering. The payment of such expenses  {E139 assume}  no unusual  circumstances or delays, or a re-solicitation in connection with the subscription and community offering. The Company and the Bank acknowledge  that such expense cap may be  {E140 increased}  by mutual consent,  including  in the event of a material delay in the Offering which would  {E141 require}  an  update of the financial information in tabular form to  {E142 reflect}  a period later than that set forth in the original filing. Section 3. Sale and Delivery of Shares. If all conditions precedent to the consummation of the Conversion,  including  without limitation, the sale of  all Shares  {E143 required}  by the Plan to be  {E144 sold}  , are satisfied, the Company  {E145 agrees}  to  {E146 issue}  , or have  {E147 issued}  , the Shares  {E144 sold}  in the Offering and to  {E149 release}   for delivery certificates for such Shares on the Closing  Date  against payment to the Company by any means authorized by the Plan; provided,  however, that no funds shall be released to the Company until the conditions specified in Section 8 hereof shall have been complied with to the  reasonable satisfaction of the Agent and its counsel. The release of Shares against payment therefor shall be  {E150 made}  on a date and at a place  acceptable to the Company, the Bank and the Agent. Certificates for shares shall be  {E151 delivered}
