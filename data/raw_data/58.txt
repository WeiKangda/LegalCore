Blue Hills Bancorp, Inc. (the "Holding Company"), a newly  {E1 formed}  Maryland corporation, Hyde Park Bancorp, MHC, a MassachusettsÂ­  {E2 chartered}  mutual  {E3 holding}  company (the "MHC"), Hyde Park Bancorp, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the "MidÂ­Tier"), and Blue Hills Bank, a MassachusettsÂ­chartered stock savings bank (the "Bank" and together with the Holding Company, the MHC and the MidÂ­Tier, the "Blue Hills Parties"), hereby  {E4 confirm}  their agreement with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. (the "Agent") as  follows  :

Section 1. The Offering. The MHC, in accordance with the plan of {E7 conversion} as  {E5 adopted}  by the Boards of Directors of each of the Blue Hills Parties (the "Plan"),  {E6 intends}  to  {E7 convert}  from the  current  mutual  {E3 holding}  company form of organization to a stock  {E9 holding}  company form of organization (the "Conversion"). Pursuant to the Plan, the Holding Company will  {E10 offer}  and  {E11 sell}  up to 24,150,000 shares (subject to  {E12 increase}  up to 27,772,500 shares) of its common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Shares"), in a subscription {E212 offering} (the "Subscription {E212 Offering}") to (1) depositors of the Bank with Qualifying Deposits (as  {E13 defined}  in the Plan) as of  February 28, 2013  ("Eligible Account Holders"), (2) the Bank's taxÂ­ qualified employee benefit plans,  {E14 including}  the employee stock ownership plan  {E15 established}  by the Bank (the "ESOP"), and (3) employees, officers, directors, trustees and corporators of the Bank, the Mid-Tier and the MHC who  do  not have a higher priority to  {E16 purchase}  stock. Subject to the prior subscription rights of the aboveÂ­listed parties, the Holding Company may  {E17 offer}  for sale in a direct community {E214 offering} (the "Community {E214 Offering}" and when  {E18 referred}  to together with or subsequent to the Subscription {E212 Offering}, the "Subscription and Community {E217 Offering}") the Shares not  {E19 subscribed}  for or  {E20 ordered}  in the Subscription  {E212 Offering}  to members of the general public to whom a copy of the Prospectus (as hereinafter  {E22 defined}  ) is  {E23 delivered}  with a preference  {E24 given}  first to natural persons and trusts of natural persons  {E25 residing}  in the local community as  {E26 defined}  in the Plan, and thereafter to  {E27 cover}  {E310 orders} of other members of the general public. It is  {E28 anticipated}  that Shares not  {E29 subscribed}  for in the Subscription and Community {E217 Offering} may be  {E219 offered}  to certain members of the general public on a best efforts basis through a  {E31 selected}  dealers {E218 agreement} (the "Syndicated Community {E219 Offering}") or to certain members of the general public in a firm commitment underwritten  {E220 offering}  (the "Underwritten {E220 Offering}") with the Agent  {E33 acting}  as sole bookÂ­running manager (the Underwritten {E220 Offering}, Subscription {E212 Offering}, Community {E214 Offering} and Syndicated Community {E219 Offering} are collectively  {E34 referred}  to as the "{E241 Offering}"). It is  {E35 acknowledged}  that the {E226 purchase} of Shares in the {E241 Offering} is subject to the maximum and minimum purchase limitations as  {E36 described}  in the Plan and that the Holding Company may  {E37 reject}  , in whole or in part, any {E228 order}  {E38 received}  in the Community {E214 Offering} or Syndicated Community {E219 Offering}. The Holding Company has  {E39 filed}  with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333Â­194486) (the "Registration Statement"),  {E40 containing}  a prospectus  {E41 relating}  to the Subscription and Community {E217 Offering}, for the {E232 registration} of the Shares under the Securities Act of  1933  (the " 1933  Act"), and has  {E42 filed}  such amendments thereof and such  {E43 amended}  prospectuses as may have been  {E44 required}  to the date hereof. The  term  "Registration Statement" shall  {E45 include}  all financial schedules and exhibits thereto, as  {E46 amended}  ,  {E47 including}  post-effective amendments. The prospectus, as  {E48 amended}  , on file with the Commission at the time the Registration Statement initially  {E49 became}  effective is hereinafter  {E50 called}  the "Prospectus," except that if any prospectus is  {E51 filed}  by the Holding Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the  1933  Act (the " 1933  Act Regulations")  {E52 differing}  from the prospectus on file at the time the Registration Statement initially  {E53 became}  effective, the  term  "Prospectus" shall  {E54 refer}  to the prospectus  {E57 filed}  pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) from and after the time  {E56 said}  prospectus is  {E57 filed}  with the Commission. In accordance with the Massachusetts General Laws and the rules and regulations  {E58 governing}  the {E233 conversion} of Massachusetts mutual  holding  companies to stock holding companies ( {E59 including}  , without limitation, Chapter 167H of the Massachusetts General Laws and Chapter 33, Subpart D of the Code of Massachusetts Regulations), as from time to time  {E60 amended}  or  {E61 supplemented}  (the "Massachusetts Regulations"), the MHC has  {E62 filed}  the Plan with the Massachusetts Division of Banks (the "Division") and has  {E63 filed}  such amendments thereto and supplementary materials as may have been  {E64 required}  to the date hereof (such application, as  {E65 amended}  to date, if applicable, and as subsequently  {E66 amended}  , if applicable, is hereinafter  {E67 referred}  to as the "Massachusetts Conversion Application"),  {E68 including}  copies of the MHC's Notice and Information Statement for a Special {E234 Meeting} of its Corporators  {E69 relating}  to the {E7 Conversion} (the "Information Statement"), the {E236 Appraisal}, and the Prospectus. In addition, the Holding Company has  {E70 filed}  with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "FRB") an Application to  {E71 Become}  a Bank Holding Company and/or  {E72 Acquire}  an Additional Bank or Bank Holding Company on Form FR YÂ­3 (the "Holding Company Application") to  {E73 become}  a bank  {E74 holding}  company under Section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act of  1956 , as  {E75 amended}  (the "BHCA"), as in effect at the time and the FRB has  {E76 approved}  the Holding Company Application. The Massachusetts Conversion Application and the Holding Company Application are collectively  {E77 referred}  to herein as the "Applications". Section 2. Retention of Agent; Compensation; Sale and Delivery of the Shares. Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Blue Hills Parties hereby  {E245 appoint}  the Agent as their exclusive financial advisor and conversion agent (i) to  {E79 utilize}  its best {E237 efforts} to  {E80 solicit}  {E238 subscriptions} for Shares and to  {E81 advise}  and  {E82 assist}  the Holding Company and the Bank with respect to the {E239 sale} of the Shares in the {E241 Offering} and (ii) to  {E83 participate}  in the {E241 Offering} in the areas of market {E242 making} and in syndicate {E243 formation} or to  {E84 act}  as sole book- {E85 running}  manager in the Underwritten {E220 Offering} (if necessary). On the basis of the representations, warranties, and agreements herein  {E86 contained}  , but subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Agent  {E87 accepts}  such {E245 appointment} and  {E88 agrees}  to  {E89 consult}  with and  {E90 advise}  the Blue Hills Parties as to the matters set forth in the letter agreements,  {E91 dated}   October 7, 2013 , among the MHC, the Mid-Tier, the Bank and the Agent (a copy of each of which is  {E92 attached}  hereto as Exhibit A and Exhibit B). It is  {E93 acknowledged}  by the Blue Hills Parties that the Agent shall not be  {E94 required}  to  {E95 purchase}  any Shares in the Subscription {E212 Offering}, Community {E214 Offering}, and Syndicated Community {E219 Offering} or be  {E96 obligated}  to  {E97 take}  any {E249 action} which is inconsistent with all applicable laws, regulations, {E250 decisions} or {E251 orders}. 2

The obligations of the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall  {E98 terminate}  upon {E252 termination} of the {E241 Offering}, but in no event later than  45 days  after the {E254 completion} of the Subscription {E212 Offering}, unless  {E101 extended}  (the "End  Date  "). All fees or expenses due to the Agent but unpaid will be payable to the Agent in  next day  funds at the earlier of the Closing  Date  (as hereinafter  {E100 defined}  ) or the End  Date  . In the event the {E241 Offering} is  {E101 extended}  beyond the End  Date  , the Blue Hills Parties and the Agent may  {E102 agree}  to  {E103 renew}  this Agreement under mutually acceptable terms. In the event the Holding Company is unable to  {E104 sell}  a minimum of 17,850,000 Shares within the period herein  {E105 provided}  , this Agreement shall  {E106 terminate}  and the Holding Company shall  {E107 refund}  to any persons who have  {E108 subscribed}  for any of the Shares the full amount which it may have  {E109 received}  from them plus  {E110 accrued}  interest, as set forth in the Prospectus; and none of the parties to this Agreement shall have any obligation to the other parties hereunder, except as set forth in this Section 2 and in Sections 7, 9 and 10 hereof. In the event the {E241 Offering} is  {E265 terminated}  for any reason not attributable to the {E263 action} or {E264 inaction} of the Agent, the Agent shall be  {E112 paid}  the fees due to the date of such {E265 termination} pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (e) below. The Agent shall  {E113 receive}  the  following  compensation for its {E261 services} hereunder:

(a) A management fee of $50,000 payable in four installments of $12,500 on the first  day  of  October 2013 ,  December 2013 ,  March 2014  and  June 2014 . Such fees shall be  {E114 deemed}  to have been  {E115 earned}  when due. Should the {E241 Offering} be  {E265 terminated}  for any reason not attributable to the {E263 action} or {E264 inaction} of Agent, Agent shall have  {E117 earned}  and be  {E118 entitled}  to be  {E119 paid}  fees  {E120 accruing}  through the stage at which point the {E265 termination}  {E121 occurred}  . (b) A Success Fee of 0.85% shall be  {E122 paid}   {E123 based}  on the aggregate purchase price of the Shares  {E124 sold}  in the Subscription {E212 Offering} and the Community  {E214 Offering}   {E126 excluding}  shares  {E127 purchased}  by the Blue Hills Parties' officers, directors, trustees or employees (or members of their immediate family) plus any ESOP, tax-qualified or stock  {E128 based}  compensation plans or similar plan  {E129 created}  by the Blue Hills Parties for some or all of their directors or employees or by the foundation (or any shares  {E130 contributed}  to the foundation). The Management Fee  {E131 described}  in Section 2(a) above will be  {E132 credited}  against the Success Fee  {E133 paid}  pursuant to this paragraph. (c) If any of the Shares  {E134 remain}  available after the Subscription {E212 Offering} and Community {E214 Offering}, at the {E269 request} of the Holding Company, Agent will  {E135 seek}  to  {E136 form}  a syndicate of  {E137 registered}  broker-dealers to  {E138 assist}  in the {E270 sale} of Shares on a best efforts basis, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a  {E155 selected}  dealers {E271 agreement} to be  {E140 entered}  into between the Holding Company and Agent. Agent will  {E141 endeavor}  to  {E142 distribute}  the Shares among dealers in a fashion which best  {E143 meets}  the distribution objectives of the Holding Company and the Plan. Agent will be  {E144 paid}  a fee not to  {E145 exceed}  5.25% of the aggregate Purchase Price of the Shares  {E146 sold}  in the Syndicated Community {E219 Offering}. From this fee, Agent will  {E147 pass}  onto  {E155 selected}  broker-dealers, who  {E149 assist}  in the Syndicated Community {E219 Offering}, an amount competitive with gross underwriting discounts  {E150 charged}  at such time for comparable amounts of stock  {E151 sold}  at a comparable price per share in a similar market environment. Fees with respect to {E274 purchases}  {E152 affected}  with the {E275 assistance} of a broker/dealer other than Agent shall be  {E153 transmitted}  by Agent to such broker/dealer. The {E276 decision} to  {E154 utilize}   {E155 selected}  broker-dealers will be  {E156 made}  by Agent upon {E277 consultation} with the Holding Company. (d) The Holding Company may  {E157 engage}  Agent to  {E158 offer}  the Shares to certain members of the general public in the Underwritten {E279 Offering} with Agent  {E159 acting}  as sole book-running manager. In the event that Agent  {E160 sells}  Shares in the Underwritten {E279 Offering}, the underwriting discount will  {E161 equal}  5.25% of the aggregate Purchase Price of the Shares  {E160 sold}  in the Underwritten {E279 Offering} to Agent and to any other broker-dealer  {E163 participating}  as an underwriter in the Underwritten {E279 Offering}. 3

(e) If, as a result of any {E281 resolicitation} of subscribers  {E164 undertaken}  by the Holding Company, the Agent reasonably  {E165 determines}  that it is  {E166 required}  or  {E167 requested}  to  {E168 provide}  significant {E284 services}, the Agent will be  {E169 entitled}  to additional {E285 compensation} for such {E284 services}, which additional {E285 compensation} will not  {E170 exceed}  $50,000. (f) The Holding Company shall  {E171 reimburse}  the Agent for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses,  {E172 including}  costs of travel, meals and lodging, photocopying, telephone, facsimile and couriers, etc. not to  {E173 exceed}  $25,000. In addition, the Holding Company will  {E174 reimburse}  the Agent for fees and expenses of its counsel not to  {E175 exceed}  $100,000. In the event of unusual circumstances or {E286 delays} or a {E287 re-solicitation} in connection with the {E294 Offering},  {E176 including}  in the event of a material {E289 delay} in the {E294 Offering} that would  {E177 require}  an {E291 update} of the financial information in tabular form to  {E178 reflect}  a period later than that set forth in the original filing of the Registration Statement, the Agent shall be  {E179 reimbursed}  for its additional expenses up to a maximum of $10,000 in the case of additional out-of-pocket expenses of the Agent, and up to an additional $25,000 in the case of additional fees and expenses of the Agent's counsel. The Holding Company will  {E180 bear}  the expenses of the {E294 Offering} customarily  {E181 borne}  by issuers  {E182 including}  , without limitation, regulatory filing fees, SEC, Blue Sky and Financial Institution Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") filing and registration fees; the fees of the Holding Company's accountants, attorneys, appraiser, transfer agent and registrar, printing, mailing and marketing and syndicate expenses  {E183 associated}  with the {E305 Conversion} and {E294 Offering}; and the fees set forth under this Section 2. Conversion Agent Services. The Agent shall also  {E184 receive}  a fee of $50,000 for certain conversion agent {E295 services} set forth in the letter agreement,  {E185 dated}   October 7, 2013 , among the MHC, the Mid-Tier, the Bank and the Agent (a copy of which is  {E186 attached}  hereto as Exhibit B), $10,000 of which has already been  {E187 paid}  to the Agent and is nonrefundable and the balance of which shall be payable to the Agent upon {E296 completion} of the {E294 Offering}. The Holding Company will  {E188 reimburse}  the Agent, upon {E298 request}  {E189 made}  from time to time, for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses  {E190 incurred}  in connection with its conversion agent {E299 services} not to  {E191 exceed}  $25,000 without the {E300 consent} of the Blue Hills Parties. However, in the event of unusual circumstances, {E301 delays} or a {E302 re-solicitation} in connection with the {E294 offering}, the total fees  {E192 paid}  to the Agent may be  {E193 increased}  by an additional amount not to  {E194 exceed}  $10,000. Section 3. Sale and Delivery of Shares. If all conditions precedent to the {E304 consummation} of the {E305 Conversion},  {E195 including}  without limitation, the {E306 sale} of all Shares  {E196 required}  by the Plan to be  {E197 sold}  , are satisfied, the Holding Company  {E198 agrees}  to  {E199 issue}  , or have  {E200 issued}  , the Shares  {E201 sold}  in the {E294 Offering} and to  {E308 release}  for {E207 delivery} certificates for such Shares on the Closing  Date  against payment to the Holding Company by any means authorized by the Plan; provided, however, that no funds shall be released to the Holding Company until the conditions specified in Section 8 hereof shall have been complied with to the reasonable satisfaction of the Agent or its counsel. The {E308 release} of Shares against payment therefor shall be  {E203 made}  on a date and at a place acceptable to the Blue Hills Parties and the Agent as set forth in Section 14. Certificates for shares shall be  {E207 delivered}  directly to the purchasers in accordance with their directions as  {E205 provided}  by the Holding Company to the Holding Company's registrar and transfer agent. The date upon which the Holding Company shall  {E308 release}  or  {E207 deliver}  the Shares  {E201 sold}  in the {E294 Offering}, in accordance with the terms herein, is  {E209 called}  the "Closing  Date  ."
