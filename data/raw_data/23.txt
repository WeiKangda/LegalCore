The basic per patient estimate for Clinical Studies is as  follows  : for  screening  Clinical Studies: $***, for long  term  follow-up Clinical Studies: $*** and for other Clinical Studies: $***. If the Parties  {E51 extend}  the  term  by mutual agreement as set forth herein, the Parties shall  {E52 negotiate}  in good faith the amount of future Study funding commitments by Adaptimmune applicable to such extended  term  . In the event a Study is  {E53 terminated}  early, then in relation to any funds  {E54 allocated}  to such Study, the Parties shall promptly  {E55 discuss}  and  {E56 agree}  upon a replacement of that Study with a new study of similar scope that is of mutual scientific interest to the Parties and that is  {E57 approved}  by the JSC, and that will be  {E58 funded}  by the Alliance Funding. If there is any Alliance Funding at the expiration or termination of this Agreement, it will be  {E59 allocated}  to studies, research or tests  {E60 agreed}  by the JSC, and such Alliance Funding will be payable in accordance with  {E61 agreed}  milestones relevant to such  {E62 agreed}  studies, research or tests. The Parties  {E63 understand}  that the compensation being  {E64 paid}  to MD Anderson under this Agreement  {E65 constitutes}  the fair market value of the services to be  {E66 provided}  hereunder. Neither MD Anderson nor Principal Investigator shall  {E67 seek}  or  {E68 accept}  reimbursement from any third-party payor for any Study items or procedures  {E69 supplied}  by or  {E70 paid}  for by Adaptimmune under this Agreement. MD Anderson  {E71 acknowledges}  that Adaptimmune may be  {E72 obligated}  to  {E73 disclose}  all payments  {E74 made}  hereunder,  including  the provision of non-monetary items of value, as may be  {E75 required}  under Applicable Law,  including  the Physician Payments Sunshine Act,  {E76 passed}  as Section 6002 of the  2010  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and, to the extent  {E77 required}  by Applicable Laws,  {E78 agrees}  to  {E79 keep}  and  {E80 maintain}  relevant records of such and, upon Adaptimmune's reasonable request,  {E81 provide}  such records to Adaptimmune to the extent such information is not already in Adaptimmune's possession, but only to the extent  {E82 required}  for Adaptimmune to  {E83 comply}  with its legally  {E84 required}  reporting obligations. MD Anderson  {E85 consents}  to such disclosure, to the extent such disclosure is  {E86 required}  for Adaptimmune to  {E87 comply}  with Applicable Laws. MD Anderson shall  {E88 ensure}  that the Principal Investigator  {E89 provides}  in a timely manner all such reasonable information to Adaptimmune necessary for Adaptimmune to  {E90 comply}  with any disclosure requirements to the extent  {E91 required}  by and in accordance with 21 C.F.R. Part 54,  including  but not  {E92 limited}  to, any information  {E93 required}  to be  {E94 disclosed}  in connection with any financial relationship between Adaptimmune and the Principal Investigators and sub-investigators  {E95 involved}  in the Study, as well as any immediate family members thereof. MD Anderson will  {E96 ensure}  that Principal Investigator promptly  {E97 updates}  any provided information if any relevant changes  {E98 occur}  during the performance of any Study and for  one year   following  completion of any Study. ***  Portions of this page have been  {E99 omitted}  pursuant to a request for Confidential Treatment and  {E100 filed}  separately with the Commission. 2

No amounts  {E101 paid}  under this Agreement are  {E102 intended}  to be for, nor shall they be  {E103 construed}  as, an offer or payment  {E104 made}  in exchange for any explicit or implicit agreement to  {E105 purchase}  ,  {E106 prescribe}  ,  {E107 recommend}  , or  {E108 provide}  a favorable formulary status, for any Adaptimmune product or service. Any such compensation will be consistent with fair market value in arms-length transactions and will not be  {E109 determined}  in a manner that  {E110 takes}  into account the volume or value of any referrals or business otherwise  {E111 generated}  between the Parties for which payment may be  {E112 made}  in whole or in part under Medicare, Medicaid or other Federal health care programs. MD Anderson and Adaptimmune each  {E113 confirm}  that in  entering  into this Agreement they have not  {E114 accepted}  any bribes or illegal inducements to  {E115 enter}  into this Agreement or to  {E116 perform}  any Study and will not  {E117 accept}  any bribe or illegal inducement or  {E118 offer}  any bribe or illegal inducement in the performance of or for the performance of any Study whether during or after the termination or expiry of this Agreement. 1.4 The nineteen million six hundred and forty four thousand Dollars US ($19,644,000) for the Studies shall be due and payable to MD Anderson  according  to the schedule  {E119 outlined}  in Table 2 in Exhibit II. The JSC  {E120 retains}  the right to  {E121 prioritize}  and  {E122 replace}  Studies as necessary subject to Section 1.6. 1.5 The Parties will  {E123 establish}  a Joint Steering Committee ("JSC") of equal representation,  {E124 comprised}  of three (3) representatives (employees, directors or consultants who are subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations) from each Party, with the representatives of each Party collectively  having  one vote on all matters to be  {E125 decided}  upon by the JSC. Each Party can  {E126 appoint}  and  {E127 replace}  its representatives in the JSC at its own discretion through timely  {E128 written}  notice to the other Party. 1.6 The JSC will have meetings (either in person, by teleconference or via electronic means) at least quarterly. At least one meeting per  year  will be  {E129 conducted}  in person or by videoconference ( including  the  kick  -off meeting). The JSC will  {E130 decide}  on matters by unanimous vote with each of MD Anderson and Adaptimmune  exercising  one vote each  {E131 provided}  , however, that no action may lawfully be  {E132 taken}  at any meeting unless at least two representatives of each Party ( including  for this purpose any proxy representative  {E133 appointed}  as  {E134 provided}  below) are present at the meeting. If a member of the JSC is unable to  {E135 attend}  a meeting, he or she may  {E136 appoint}  , in writing, a proxy to  {E137 participate}  and  {E138 vote}  in his or her stead. Decisions may also be  {E139 made}  by electronic mail,  {E140 provided}  such electronic mail is  {E141 provided}  by at least two representatives from Adaptimmune and MD Anderson and such electronic mail is  {E142 acknowledged}  to be  {E143 received}  by the recipient. Although decision will be  {E144 made}  by mutual agreement of the JSC, in the event of any disagreement, ***           . 1.7 The main task of the JSC will be to  {E145 oversee}  the Alliance. In order to  {E146 achieve}  the objectives of the Alliance, the JSC will  {E147 oversee}  each Study under the Alliance. The JSC will  {E148 provide}  technical, scientific, clinical, and regulatory guidance to the Studies and will be responsible for  monitoring  progress of these Studies. Additional representatives can be  {E149 invited}  by the JSC on a case by case basis should discussion of certain topics  {E150 require}  so,  {E151 provided}  that such guests will be subject to an obligation of confidentiality and non- use  at least as strict as Section 5 below. In the event a Study is  {E53 terminated}  early or  does  not  {E153 initiate}  , the Parties shall promptly  {E154 replace}  that Study with a new study similar in scope that is of mutual scientific interest to the Parties. Once  {E155 agreed}  by the JSC, such replacement study will be  {E156 funded}  by the Alliance Funding and payable in accordance with  {E157 agreed}  milestones for such replacement study. ***  Portions of this page have been  {E158 omitted}  pursuant to a request for Confidential Treatment and  {E159 filed}  separately with the Commission. 3

1.8 In addition, the JSC will be responsible for  coordinating  resolution of problems  arising  in the Studies or in the Alliance as a whole. In the event of any matter to which the JSC cannot  {E160 reach}  resolution, or in the event of any dispute  arising  as to any matter subject to JSC responsibility and  {E161 save}  where Adaptimmune has the  deciding  vote in accordance with Section 1.6 above, such matter or dispute will be  {E162 escalated}  to executive management of MD Anderson and Adaptimmune for good faith resolution. Both Parties shall  {E163 use}  all reasonable efforts to  {E164 resolve}  any matter or dispute on a timely basis. 1.9 MD Anderson  {E165 represents}  and certifies that neither MD Anderson nor Principal Investigator will, directly or indirectly,  {E166 offer}  or  {E167 pay}  , or  {E168 authorize}  an offer or payment of, any money or anything of value to any Public Official ( {E169 defined}  below) or public entity, with the knowledge or intent that the payment,  {E170 promise}  or gift, in whole or in part, will be  {E171 made}  in order to improperly  {E172 influence}  an official act or decision that will  {E173 assist}  Adaptimmune in  securing  an improper advantage or in  obtaining  or  retaining  business or in  directing  business to any person or entity in relation to the Study. In addition to other rights or remedies under this Agreement or at law, Adaptimmune may  {E174 terminate}  the  {E175 affected}  Study Order if MD Anderson  {E176 breaches}  any of the representations or certifications  {E177 contained}  in this Section or if Adaptimmune  {E178 learns}  that improper payments are being or have been  {E179 made}  to any Public Official by MD Anderson or Investigator. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Public Official" means any officer or employee of a government, a public international organization or any department or agency thereof, or any person acting in an official capacity, including, for a public agency or enterprise; and any political party or party official, or any candidate for public office. Adaptimmune  {E180 acknowledges}  and  {E181 agrees}  that MD Anderson is an agency of the State of Texas, and its investigator, employees, and officers  do   {E182 constitute}  a Public Official, as  {E183 used}  in this paragraph, for purposes of this Section. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 1.9, nothing in this Section shall  {E184 constitute}  a limitation on MD Anderson's ability to  {E185 operate}  within its legal capacity as an agency of the State of Texas, nor shall anything in this Agreement  {E186 require}  MD Anderson to  {E187 violate}  any law or to  {E188 refrain}  from  complying  with any law applicable to MD Anderson. 2. Responsibilities and Compliance   2.1 Each Clinical Study shall be subject to review and approval of the Study protocol ("Protocol") as  {E189 required}  by MD Anderson's Institutional Review Board ("Institutional Review Board" or "IRB") and/or any relevant authorities prior to commencement of the Study as may be  {E190 required}  in order to  {E191 comply}  with Applicable Laws. 2.2 The scope of the Study to be  {E192 performed}  shall be set forth in the Protocol(s) or workscope  {E193 referenced}  in the Study Order, which shall be  {E194 incorporated}  by reference into such Study Order. These Protocol(s)/workscope shall be  {E195 considered}  final after being  {E196 agreed}  to by MD Anderson and Adaptimmune and, for Clinical Studies,  including  approval by MD Anderson's IRB. The Principal Investigator for a Clinical Study shall  {E197 submit}  the Protocol and reports of the ongoing conduct of the Clinical Study to the IRB as  {E198 required}  by the IRB,  {E199 obtain}   {E200 written}  approval from the IRB, and  {E201 inform}  the IRB of Study closure.
