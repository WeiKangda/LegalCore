All payments shall be  {E141 made}  in United States Dollars, free of any withholding tax and of any currency control or other restrictions to PivX. PivX shall have the right, at reasonable times and on reasonable notice, to  {E142 inspect}  and  {E143 audit}  the books and records of Detto to  {E144 verify}  the accuracy of any statements. In the event that such an inspection  {E145 discloses}  any error of any amount, the parties shall by appropriate payment promptly  {E146 adjust}  for the error. If Detto  {E147 fails}  to  {E148 make}  payments when due, PivX shall be  {E149 entitled}  to, in its sole discretion, to  {E150 take}  any one or more of the following: (a) place Detto on credit hold, in which case, PivX may  {E151 cease}  to  {E152 fulfill}  Detto's orders to any new Third Parties; (b) rescind Detto's right to  {E153 sell}  or  {E154 distribute}  any additional Qwik-Fix Pro or Documentation hereunder; and (c) to  {E155 require}  that Detto  {E156 direct}  all future payments, for licenses  {E157 sold}  in the past or in the future, from the Third Parties directly to PivX or a lock box or





an account  {E158 designated}  by PivX for such purpose, to be  {E159 applied}  by PivX to the payment default (and interest thereon) until such defaults have been satisfied. All amounts  {E160 received}  by PivX hereunder shall be nonrefundable except for any payments  {E161 received}  or  {E162 held}  under PivX's control pursuant to clause "c" of the last sentence after Detto's payment default has been  {E163 satisfied}  . 3.4 TAXES, TARIFFS, FEES.

Should any tax or levy be  {E170 made}  , Detto  {E171 agrees}  to  {E172 pay}  such tax or levy and  {E173 indemnify}  PivX against any claim for such amount. Detto  {E174 represents}  and warrants to  {E175 PivX}  that all Qwik-Fix Pro  {E176 acquired}  hereunder is for redistribution in the ordinary course of Detto's business, and Detto  {E177 agrees}  to  {E178 provide}  PivX with appropriate resale certificate numbers and other documentation satisfactory to the applicable  taxing  authorities to  {E179 substantiate}  any claim of exemption from any such taxes or fees. 3.5 SHIPMENT AND DELIVERY.

Should Detto  {E186 fail}  to  {E187 give}  such notice, or  {E188 fail}  to  {E189 obtain}  an extension of such  10-day period  from PivX, the packages shall be  {E190 deemed}  to be  {E191 accepted}  by Detto. PivX will reasonably  {E192 accommodate}  Detto's request to  {E193 replace}  its master copy of software that  {E194 becomes}   {E195 corrupted}  or  {E196 damaged}  .

PivX shall  {E201 use}  commercially reasonable efforts to  {E202 meet}  delivery dates  {E203 requested}  by Detto, but in no event shall PivX be liable for its failure to  {E204 meet}  such dates. In the event that PivX shall be unable to  {E205 meet}  Detto's requested ship dates, PivX shall  {E206 advise}  Detto of the change in or actual delivery schedule. 3
