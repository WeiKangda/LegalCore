WHEREAS, Distributor is  {E22 engaged}  in the {E260 promotion} of {E261 sales} of telecommunications products; and

WHEREAS, Airspan  {E23 desires}  to  {E263 appoint}  Distributor as a Distributor for the Airspan Products for the territory  {E25 described}  in Schedule II hereto (the "Territory"). NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein  {E26 contained}  , it is hereby  {E27 agreed}  as  follows  :

1. APPOINTMENT. -----------

1.1  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Airspan hereby  {E263 appoints}  Distributor as an independent, exclusive distributor to  {E29 assist}  Airspan in  {E30 marketing}  the Airspan Products to customers in the Territory, and Distributor hereby  {E31 accepts}  such {E263 appointment} as of the Effective  Date  of this Agreement. Distributor's {E263 appointment} as a distributor of the Airspan Products grants to Distributor only a license to  {E32 resell}  the

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Airspan Products to Distributor's customers in the Territory, and  does  not  {E33 transfer}  any right, title, or interest in any of the Airspan Software to Distributor. 1.2  Distributor's relationship to Airspan is that of an independent contractor, and nothing in this Agreement shall  {E34 constitute}  Distributor as the agent or employee of Airspan. Distributor shall have no authority to  {E35 accept}  any {E264 order} or  {E36 make}  any {E265 offer} (except as herein  {E37 stated}  ), or  {E38 execute}  any instrument or  {E39 make}  any {E344 commitment} on behalf of Airspan. Specifically, without in any way  {E40 limiting}  the generality of the foregoing, Distributor  {E41 agrees}  not to  {E42 make}  any {E346 representation}, {E348 guarantee}, or {E350 warranty} on Airspan's behalf  {E43 concerning}  the Airspan Products, but will  {E44 refer}  customers to Airspan's  {E45 printed}  literature. Nothing  {E46 contained}  in this Agreement is to be  {E47 construed}  as a limitation or restriction upon Airspan in the {E266 sale} or other {E267 disposition} of any of its products to any person, firm, or corporation inside or outside of the Territory. Airspan will  {E48 pay}  no commissions under this Agreement. Distributor's {E268 compensation} is to be  {E49 obtained}  solely by the difference between the price Distributor  {E50 pays}  to Airspan and the price Distributor  {E51 charges}  its customers. The parties also  {E52 acknowledge}  that this Agreement is not  {E53 intended}  to  {E54 create}  a joint venture or partnership between Airspan and Distributor. 1.3  Distributor will  {E55 use}  its best {E269 efforts} to  {E56 maintain}  and  {E57 support}  the Airspan Products within the Territory by  {E58 devoting}  such attention, time, and effort as may be reasonably necessary to fully  {E59 develop}  the available market potential. During the  term  of this Agreement, and for a period of three (3)  months   {E60 following}  the {E270 expiration} or {E271 termination} of this Agreement, Distributor  {E61 agrees}  that neither it nor any organization or entity  {E62 controlled}  or  {E63 directed}  by it will, without Airspan's prior,  {E64 written}  consent,  {E65 represent}  a manufacturer or supplier of products similar in design or performance to or which are of such a nature as to be competitive with any products  {E66 contained}  in the Airspan Products, nor will Distributor market or otherwise  {E67 promote}  the {E272 sale} of such products. Distributor will  {E68 give}  Airspan thirty (30)  days  ' prior,  {E69 written}  notice of each new potential representation role being  {E70 considered}  by Distributor, and Distributor will not  {E71 undertake}  such representation without Airspan's prior,  {E72 written}  consent, such consent not to be unreasonably  {E73 withheld}  . Except as

{E74 provided}  above, in no event will  Airspan  consent to Distributor's {E273 consultation} for or {E274 representation} of a manufacturer or supplier, which is directly or indirectly, a competitor of Airspan. 1.4  Distributor shall  {E75 maintain}  a place of business at the location  {E76 specified}  in Section 21.10 where Distributor can be  {E77 contacted}  by Airspan, customers, and prospective customers during regular business hours with a permanent mailing address and an accessible cellular telephone, and will  {E78 provide}  Airspan with  {E79 written}  notice promptly upon any change in address. Distributor  {E80 agrees}  to  {E81 assume}  all of the expenses of this place of business,  {E82 including}  rent, stenographic services, and all other expenses except as specifically  {E83 assumed}  in writing by Airspan. - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
