The University and/or Principal Investigator together with ArTara and the CRO will  {E40 conduct}  the Project in accordance with the Project Plan and will  {E41 use}  all reasonable endeavors consistent with their expertise to successfully  {E42 complete}  the Project. It is the goal of the Project to  {E43 use}  the Program Data as clinical support for Product Regulatory Filings and to  {E44 gain}  approval to  {E45 commercialize}  the Product for the Indication in the Territory. 2.2 Project Plan. The Project Plan as  {E46 approved}  by each of the Parties may be  {E47 modified}  or  {E48 amended}  only upon mutual agreement of each of the Parties. The Project will  {E49 consist}  of three phases: (a) Phase I: University and/or Principal Investigator will  {E50 provide}  access to the Program Data to ArTara and the CRO at the University's facilities. ArTara and the CRO will be  {E51 allowed}  to  {E52 make}  complete copies of the original Program Data for the purposes of off-site data entry and storage, all as and only to the extent  {E53 needed}  to  {E54 support}  ArTara's efforts to  {E55 accomplish}  the Project. University will  {E56 provide}  ArTara and CRO the opportunity to  {E57 examine}  the originals of medical records and  supporting  records for the Program Data at the University during normal business hours and at mutually agreeable times. University and Principal Investigator will also  {E58 provide}  to ArTara contact information for other  participating  investigators and research sites that have  {E59 contributed}  data to the Program. University will  {E60 retain}  all Program Data for the sooner to  {E61 occur}  of a New Drug Application (NDA) for the Product being  {E62 approved}  or ten (10)  years  from the Effective  Date  . ArTara will  {E63 bear}  any costs  {E64 related}  to necessary long- term  on or off-site storage of the Program Data, medical records and/or  supporting  records. ArTara  {E65 understands}  that separate engagement agreements may be  {E66 required}  by  collaborating  third party entities and  {E67 associated}  principal investigators and University will  {E68 assist}  ArTara in  obtaining  such agreements. It is  {E69 understood}  that the goal of Phase I is a feasibility analysis of the Program Data to  {E70 support}  Regulatory Filings in the United States. (b) Phase II: University  {E71 recognizes}  that because of ArTara's unfamiliarity with the Program Data database, assistance from the Principal Investigator and other research and medical employees of the University may from time to time be  {E72 needed}  for ArTara to  {E73 query}  and  {E74 analyze}  the Program Data database as  {E75 needed}  to  {E76 achieve}  successful presentation to applicable Regulatory Authorities and submission of Regulatory Filings. ArTara will  {E77 endeavor}  to  {E78 minimize}  University resources  {E79 required}  during Phase II. The goal of Phase II will be to  {E80 compile}  the Project Documentation. (c) Phase III: CRO will  {E81 convert}  Program Data to  eCTD  format for submission to Regulatory Authorities. University  {E82 recognizes}  that ArTara may  {E83 receive}  specific data requests from Regulatory Authorities in connection with ArTara's presentations of Program Data to  {E70 support}  Regulatory Filings. University will  {E85 assist}  ArTara in  responding  to such requests for data or access to  {E86 source}  data from Regulatory Authorities. ArTara  {E87 agrees}  to  {E88 notify}  University of such requests as soon as is practicable. The goal of Phase III will be filing of a BLA  {E89 based}  on Project Documentation and response to Regulatory Authorities. 4

(d) Phase IV Optional: Upon mutual  {E90 written}  agreement of University and ArTara, ArTara may  {E91 sponsor}  , and University may  {E92 conduct}  , new Product or Product- {E93 related}  clinical studies (for example,  follow  -up studies) to  {E94 support}  the goal of the Project or as may be useful for  gaining  or  maintaining  Regulatory Approvals for the Product for the Indication. Any such studies will be at the sole discretion of each Party subject to terms and conditions to be mutually  {E95 agreed}  upon in agreements separate from this Agreement. Richard Smith, MD will be  {E96 given}  first consideration as a principal investigator for all new Product or Product- related clinical studies, in addition to other sites  {E97 provided}  final site selection will be  {E98 based}  on the best interest of the Project. (e) Phase V: Publication:  {E99 Collected}  data from the Project will be  {E100 used}  to  {E101 write}  a paper by the University and/or Principal Investigator (the "Publication") as a follow up to the publication in  2009  (Smith MC, Zimmerman MB, Burke DK, Bauman NM, Sato Y, Smith RJ; OK-432 Collaborative Study Group. Efficacy and safety of OK-432 immunotherapy of lymphatic malformations. Laryngoscope. 2009Jan;119(1):107-15. doi: 10.1002/lary.20041. PubMed PMID: 19117316) . ( the "Publication"). The Publication will be in accordance with the terms in Article 5 herein. 2.3 Project Management. During the  term  of this Agreement, the Principal Investigator and and/or his authorized representative and ArTara  {E102 authorized}  representatives will  {E103 meet}  as necessary to  {E104 consult}  with one another and  {E105 discuss}  the progress and results of the Project and any modifications to the Project Plan. Consultation by either Party shall be by means of personal visits, correspondence and telephone calls, all as appear reasonable and necessary and are mutually agreed upon by the Principal Investigator and ArTara. ARTICLE THREE FUNDING AND PAYMENT 3.1 Funding. During the  term  of the Project in accordance with the Project Plan, ArTara will  {E106 provide}  thirty thousand dollars (US $30,000) per  year  in funding for the Project,  taking  into consideration the time  {E107 spent}  by University employees  {E108 required}  for the Project. The Parties  {E109 agree}  to  {E110 discuss}  in good faith potential additional funding  {E111 required}  for completion of the Project as applicable and necessary. 3.2 Approval Milestone  {E112 based}  on Data Value: Within forty-five (45)  days  of an approval of the TARA-002 BLA by the FDA, ArTara will  {E113 pay}  a one- time approval milestone to University pursuant to the usefulness of the Program Data in TARA-002's BLA filing, as set forth below: Official Feedback from FDA  regarding  the Program Data Milestone [â¦***â¦] $[â¦***â¦] [â¦***â¦] $[â¦***â¦] [â¦***â¦] $[â¦***â¦] [â¦***â¦] [â¦***â¦]
