own discretion,  {E151 give}  partial shipments to large orders. In no event will       the Company be  {E152 obligated}  to  {E153 provide}  Products to the Agent in excess of one       hundred and twenty percent (120%) of any maximum quantity  {E154 specified}  in the       applicable Business Plan;

(b)  {E155 provide}  to the Agent's field sales personnel at least four (4)       hours of initial Products sales and marketing training, and Agent        telesales  personnel at least one (1) hour of initial Product sales and       marketing training, and such supplemental training, if any, as the Company       may  {E156 deem}  appropriate, in each case, at such times and locations as may be       mutually  {E157 agreed}  upon by the Company and the Agent. (c)  {E158 supply}  such literature, ad reprints and other promotional aids       and furnish Agent with other information that in the opinion of the       Company may be helpful in the sale of  {E159 listed}  Product(s). (d)  {E160 compensate}  the Agent through a discount of eight (8) percent off       of the  current  price of the Product times the total  monthly  units  {E117 shipped}        at that price to the Customer in the Agent's Territory  {E162 excluding}  any       taxes, and/or shipping and handling charges  {E163 incurred}  by the Company. The       Company will  {E164 compensate}  the Agent an additional two (2) percent through a       discount off of the  current  price or promotional price of the Product        times  the total  monthly  units  {E117 shipped}  at that price to the Customer        {E166 excluding}  any taxes, and/or shipping and handling charges  {E167 incurred}  by the       Company, so as to  {E168 compensate}  the Agent's sales representatives. Therefore,       a total of ten (10) percent discount off of the  current  price list or       promotional price times the total  monthly  units  {E117 shipped}  at that price to       the Customer will be  {E170 applied}  as payment for services from the Agent        {E171 including}  , but not  {E172 limited}  to, the promotion, sales, and collection of       payment from the Customer for Product  {E117 shipped}  by the Company. In addition       the Company will  {E174 compensate}  the Agent quarterly an additional two (2)       percent commission (incentive), exclusive of taxes, and  /or  shipping and       handling charges  {E175 incurred}  by the Company,  {E176 based}  upon the attainment of       mutually  {E177 agreed}  upon quarterly goals. One (1) percent of this incentive is       additional compensation for the Agent, and one (1) percent is for       additional compensation of the Agency sales force. In the event the Agent        {E178 fails}  to  {E179 achieve}  these goals during any  {E180 given}  quarter yet is able to        {E181 achieve}  the overall  annual  goals, then the Agent will  {E182 receive}  the       incentive commission for  that quarter  at the conclusion of the fiscal        year  . These goals are  {E183 outlined}  in exhibit B. (e) will  {E184 replace}  , any unit of Product to the Customer which has        {E185 outdated}  ( {E186 provided}  the Product is not  {E187 outdated}  more than ninety (90)  days  )       with equal Product. 7
