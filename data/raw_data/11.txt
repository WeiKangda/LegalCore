It is  {E12 anticipated}   that shares not  {E13 subscribed}  for in the Subscription  and Community  Offering will be  {E14 offered}  to certain  members of the general  public on a best efforts basis through a  {E15 selected}   dealers  arrangement (the "Syndicated  Community  Offering") (the  Subscription  Offering,  Community Offering and Syndicated  Community Offering are collectively   {E16 referred}  to as the "Offering").
